1;1.1 By 2030, eradicate extreme poverty for all people everywhere, currently measured as people living on less than $1.25 a day;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
2;1.2 By 2030, reduce at least by half the proportion of men, women and children of all ages living in poverty in all its dimensions according to national definitions;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

8;The share of the world population living in extreme poverty declined to 10 per cent in 2015, down from 16 per cent in 2010 and 36 per cent in 1990. However, the pace of poverty reduction is decelerating, with a “nowcast” of 8.6 per cent in 2018. Moreover, baseline projections suggest that 6 per cent of the world population will still be living in extreme poverty in 2030, missing the target of ending poverty.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
9;Despite having a job, 8 per cent of the world’s workers and their families still lived in extreme poverty in 2018. The situation remains particularly alarming in sub-Saharan Africa, where the share of working poor stood at 38 per cent in 2018.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
10;Social protection systems help prevent and reduce poverty and provide a safety net for the vulnerable. However, social protection is not a reality for a large majority of the world’s population. In 2016, 55 per cent – as many as 4 billion people – were not covered by any social protection cash benefits, with large variations across regions: from 87 per cent without coverage in sub-Saharan Africa to 14 per cent in Europe and Northern America.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
11;Only 22 per cent of unemployed persons receive unemployment cash benefits, only 28 per cent of persons with severe disabilities receive disability cash benefits, only 35 per cent of children worldwide enjoy effective access to social protection and only 41 per cent of women giving birth receive maternity cash benefits.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
12;Disasters often lead to a downturn in the trajectory of socioeconomic development and exacerbate poverty. From 1998 to 2017, direct economic losses from disasters were estimated at almost $3 trillion, of which climate - related disasters accounted for 77 per cent of the total – a rise of 151 per cent compared with the period from 1978 to 1997 – and climate-related and geophysical disasters claimed an estimated 1.3 million lives. More than 90 per cent of deaths reported internationally were due to disaster events in low- and middle-income countries, and economic losses from disasters as a percentage of gross domestic product (GDP) were also much higher in these countries.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
13;The rate of extreme poverty has fallen rapidly: in 2013 it was a third of the 1990 value. The latest global estimate suggests that 11 per cent of the world population, or 783 million people, lived below the extreme poverty threshold in 2013.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
14;The proportion of the world’s workers living with their families on less than $1.90 per person a day declined significantly over the past two decades, falling from 26.9 per cent in 2000 to 9.2 per cent in 2017.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
15;Based on 2016 estimates, only 45 per cent of the world’s population were effectively covered by at least one social protection cash benefit.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
16;an estimated 767 million people lived below the international poverty line of $1.90 a day — down from 1.7 billion people in 1999. That figure reflects a decrease in the global poverty rate from 28 per cent in 1999 to 11 per cent in 2013. The most significant progress was seen in Eastern and SouthEastern Asia, where the rate declined from 35 per cent in 1999 to 3 per cent in 2013. In contrast, 42 per cent of people in sub-Saharan Africa continued to subsist in conditions of extreme poverty in 2013.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
17;Social protection systems are fundamental to preventing and reducing poverty and inequality at every stage of people’s lives, through benefits for children, mothers with newborns, persons with disabilities, older persons and thoses persons who are poor and without jobs. Preliminary data show that in 2016, only 45 per cent of the world’s population was effectively protected by a social protection system and that coverage varied widely across countries and regions.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
18;Poverty is not  having enough material possessions or income for a person's needs.  Poverty may include social, economic, and political elements.\nAbsolute poverty is the complete lack of the means necessary to meet basic personal needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter.  The threshold at which absolute poverty is defined is always about the same, independent of the person's permanent location or era.\nOn the other hand, relative poverty occurs when a person cannot meet a minimum level of living standards, compared to others in the same time and place. Therefore, the threshold at which relative poverty is defined varies from one country to another, or from one society to another.  For example, a person who cannot afford housing better than a small tent in an open field would be said to live in relative poverty if almost everyone else in that area lives in modern brick homes, but not if everyone else also lives in small tents in open fields (for example, in a nomadic tribe).\nGovernments and non-governmental organizations try to reduce poverty.  Providing basic needs to people who are unable to earn a sufficient income can be hampered by constraints on government's ability to deliver services, such as corruption, tax avoidance, debt and loan conditionalities and by the brain drain of health care and educational professionals. Strategies of increasing income to make basic needs more affordable typically include welfare, economic freedoms and providing financial services.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
19;The objective of Sustainable Development Goal 1 is to end to poverty in all its manifestations, including extreme poverty, over the next 15 years beginning in 2016. All people everywhere, including the poorest and most vulnerable, should enjoy a basic standard of living and the benefits of adequate social protection. Indeed, eradicating poverty remains one of the greatest global challenges today, hence the continued focus on this overarching goal in the 2030 Agenda and in Agenda 2063.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
20;Experience with urban social assistance programmes is still limited. Many of the existing urban programmes are extensions or duplicates of rural programmes, but urban-sensitive social protection needs to reflect the distinct vulnerabilities of the urban poor. Furthermore, applying a child lens requires identifying and addressing the specific risks and multiple deprivations that are experienced by half of urban children in developing countries. As a result, designing social assistance for urban contexts faces challenges such as accurately targeting the poor (given the spatial geography of urban poverty) and setting appropriate payment levels (given the high and variable costs of urban living). Geographic targeting (e.g. informal settlements), proxy means testing (if urban-sensitive) and categorical targeting (e.g. street children) are popular mechanisms in urban areas, but community-based targeting is often inappropriate (because of urban social fragmentation) while self-targeting can be unethical (e.g. where wages below market rates are paid in public works projects) and might contradict rights-based approaches. These are relevant challenges to address when designing urban social protection programmes. We apply these reflections to Ghana. The country is a relevant case study because it is growing and urbanizing rapidly. But as the result of urbanization, urban poverty and deprivations are rising even though national poverty rates have halved. Anti-poverty policies and social protection interventions remain biased towards the rural poor. The ‘urbanization of poverty’ in Ghana has created problems such as overcrowded housing, limited access to sanitation, and outbreaks of communicable diseases. This paper provides guidance on the critical questions to ask to design in Ghana a successful urban social protection programme with a child lens.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
21;This paper provides an overview of the main trends in child income poverty since the mid-2000s, and explores to what extent child poverty trends are linked to demographic, policy and/or labour market changes. Trends in poverty and the standard of living of children in low-income families since the onset of the Great Recession are also closely examined: nearly 1 in 7 children is income-poor in the OECD, and child poverty increased in almost two/thirds of OECD countries with the Great Recession. About 1 in 10 children across the OECD live in a family with a standard of living below the 2005 poverty line. Children in low-income families experienced a decline in their standard of living in many countries, with the largest decline among families with the smallest incomes.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
22;Eradicating extreme poverty is at the centre of all international development efforts. Since 2000, the United Nations has embedded the goal of eradicating extreme hunger and poverty in the first of the Millennium Development Goals (MDG). Likewise, ending poverty in all its forms and dimensions is the first of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) and an integral part of the entire 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
23;signing Agenda 2030, Governments around the world committed to ending poverty in all its manifestations, including its most extreme forms, over the next 15 years. They resolved that all people everywhere should enjoy a basic standard of living. This includes social protection benefits for the poor and most vulnerable and ensuring that people harmed by conflict and natural hazards receive adequate support, including access to basic services.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
24;We use panel data for Brazilian states from 1995 to 2009 to analyse the impact of economic growth and income inequality on poverty change in Brazil, seeking to evaluate the Bourguignon (2003) hypothesis that the more unequal a country is, the less effective economic growth will be at reducing poverty. To this end, we estimate poverty elasticities relative to income and inequality, specifying two dynamic econometric models estimated via the generalized method of moments (GMM) system developed by Arellano and Bond (1991), Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998). The model-estimated results prompt the conclusion that the income growth effect on poverty reduction is smaller when the initial development level is low. The same is found when the initial inequality level is high. Therefore, regions with a low initial development level, high initial inequality or both present less favourable conditions for reducing poverty through income growth.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
25;"In this edition of the Social Panorama of Latin America, the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean (ECLAC) provides an update on the magnitude and trends of poverty and related factors. Section A of this chapter analyses the evolution of poverty and extreme poverty since 2002, and it reviews recent trends in both indicators in the individual countries, based on the corresponding national estimates. Section B then describes how poverty has affected certain population groups depending on gender, age and area of residence. It then examines some of the factors driving poverty trends and analyses the impact of changes in average household income and its distribution and the changes observed in the different components of income in households in situations of poverty. In keeping with the central theme of this edition of the Social Panorama of Latin America, section D analyses the sufficiency of labour income and pensions as multiples of the poverty line; and it also reviews the effects of the levels of each type of income on the situation of poverty and extreme poverty. The chapter closes with a brief methodological annex on updating ECLAC poverty estimates.";1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
26;No one is more vulnerable to poverty than children. Poverty perpetuates the cycle of disadvantage and inequity, which robs millions of children of their potential and causes irreparable damage that reverberates throughout a lifetime. Putting children at the heart of poverty reduction is one of the best ways to break that cycle and create a level playing field for every child.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
27;The paper provides an examination of the relevance of ethics to poverty reduction. Ethics examines the nature and scope of institutions as the deepest level of analysis. The ethics of poverty is understood as the principles and processes of justification employed to justify assisting people in poverty. The paper argues that ethical perspectives are relevant to understanding poverty and the priority given to poverty reduction in society. It further argues that ethical perspectives inform the design and scope of anti-poverty programmes. Drawing on the recent expansion of social assistance in Brazil, South Africa and Ghana, the paper shows that ethical perspectives are relevant to our understanding of the evolution of anti-poverty policy.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
28;Social protection is at the centre of Ethiopia’s development policy. It is instrumental in reducing poverty and increasing the resilience of the population. The Government of Ethiopia (GoE) has published a new set of policy frameworks for social protection that envisage the expansion of social protection to cover a greater proportion of Ethiopians against a broader range of risks, and that call for social protection to be increasingly financed from domestic sources rather than by donors. A financing strategy for the implementation of this vision has been identified as a priority by the GoE. This study responds to this requirement. It provides a comprehensive mapping of social protection spending across the five focus areas of the national social protection policy and analyses the fiscal space available for different spending scenarios up to 2025/26. The study focuses on two issues in particular: the role of donor financing for social protection and the relationship between humanitarian relief and social protection spending.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
29;Poverty is a result of economic imbalances whereby the poor are unable to secure decent jobs or deliver their produce to markets, and social depravations whereby they lack access to basic public services, such as education, health, drinking water, sanitation and electricity. This multidimensionality of poverty undermines human development on multiple fronts.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
30;This chapter provides a forward-looking assessment of risk and vulnerability in Cambodia. While monetary poverty has fallen rapidly since the early 2000s and inequality has also declined, a large population is vulnerable to falling back into poverty. The analysis demonstrated that deprivation levels have not declined as quickly as monetary poverty. Climate change, large-scale internal and international migration, rapid urbanisation and changes to the age structure of the population are likely to determine demand for social protection over the longer term. The extent to which Cambodia is able to diversify its economy will also be a critical factor.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
31;Employment is pivotal to strengthening the economic recovery, increasing social welfare and redressing poverty. Jobs are returning, making inroads into high unemployment, but their wages and skill levels are lower than many that were lost during the crisis. Greece’s hiring is benefiting from more flexible arrangements. Legislative amendments can maintain this flexibility, ensure wages align with productivity and better protect individuals from labour market risks. Ensuring that workers possess skills that match employers’ needs will sustain employment and productivity growth. Improving the education system is a long-term mission and involves raising its pedagogical strength and orientation towards professional needs. A social welfare system dominated by pensions has not been able to prevent a steep hike in poverty among children and the young, risking long-term harm to well-being. Pursuing recent steps towards a better targeted social protection, accompanied by support programmes for jobseekers, will provide a reliable safety net and reduce poverty.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
32;While the monetary approach highlights the relevance of income and consumption to measuring poverty, the capability and social exclusion approaches stress the importance of other dimensions that characterize non-monetary poverty.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
33;This paper compares the situation of children in Korea relative to other OECD countries in terms of child poverty and well-being. First, trends in child poverty and living standards are described. An overview of key internationally available indicators of child well-being is also provided. The paper discusses the observed poverty trends in relation to social protection programs and to policies implemented to support families. Some priorities for action to make the alleviation of child poverty more effective are discussed.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
34;or decades poverty eradication has been a global development goal and for many countries a national policy priority. The adoption of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development by the United Nations General Assembly on 25 September 2015 has further raised the level of ambition and increased the scope for monitoring poverty around the world. As stated in the Preamble to the Agenda, “…eradicating poverty in all its forms and dimensions, including extreme poverty, is the greatest global challenge and an indispensable requirement for sustainable development.”;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
35;"The extent to which income inequality and poverty vary within countries across different regions is very relevant for policy decisions and monitoring. However, sub-national measures are scarce, given the complexity of producing indicators at the regional level from the available data and the methodological issues related to cross-countries comparability. This paper presents a set of indicators of income inequality and poverty across and within regions for 28 OECD countries. These indicators were produced through a new household-level data collection based on internationally harmonized income definitions undertaken as part of the OECD project on “Measuring regional and local well-being for policymaking”. The data were collected at the OECD TL2 territorial level, corresponding to NUTS2 regions in Europe and to large administrative subdivisions (e.g. States in Mexico and Unites States) for non-European countries.
These estimates confirm that there are significant variations in levels of income inequality within countries, and that regional breakdowns are useful for understanding sources and patterns of income disparities and poverty. For most of the countries relying on survey data for measuring income distribution, standard cross-sectional indicators of income inequality and relative poverty at this regional level are estimated with low precision in the smallest regions due to small samples. This has two main implications for data producers and analysts. First, systematic reporting of confidence intervals is needed to make meaningful comparisons of inequality levels across regions and with respect to the national averages. Second, averaged measures for multiple years or small area estimation methods should be considered as means for obtaining more robust measures. The issues related to the estimation of standard errors for three-year averages in rotational panel surveys and to the definition of the computational sampling structure for sub-national estimates are discussed in the paper.";1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
36;"This study analyses the impact of economic growth and income inequality on poverty in Brazil in the years from 1981 to 2013. A dynamic panel model was used, estimated by the twostep generalized method-of-moments system developed by Blundell-Bond (1998), in order to analyse three scenarios: the first corresponds to the entire period covered by this study (i.e. 1981-2013); the second encompasses the years from 1981 to 1994 (the period leading up to the Real Plan); and the third is the period from 1995 to 2013 (the years following the implementation of the Real Plan). The results indicate that economic growth policies that promote an increase in income in conjunction with a reduction in income disparities are more effective in combating poverty in Brazil than those that focus only on raising mean income levels. The findings also point to the existence of a pro-poor form of growth in the period following the Real Plan.";1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
37;This chapter uses information available as of 2014 to set out the current situation of Latin America regarding poverty and income distribution. According to ECLAC estimates, average poverty and indigence rates did not alter significantly in the region as a whole between 2012 and 2014, which raises doubts about the prospects for progress in these areas over the coming years, given the current economic environment. However, examination of the figures for the individual countries shows that a number of these did make progress in reducing poverty and indigence indicators, while others experienced reverses in the same period.;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

84;An estimated 821 million people – approximately 1 in 9 people in the world – were undernourished in 2017, up from 784 million in 2015. This represents a worrying rise in world hunger for a third consecutive year after a prolonged decline. Africa remains the continent with the highest prevalence of undernourishment, affecting one fifth of its population (more than 256 million people). Consistent with the continued growth in undernourishment, 770 million people faced severe food insecurity in 2017.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
85;Stunting has been decreasing in nearly every region since 2000. Still, more than 1 in 5 children under 5 years of age (149 million) were stunted in 2018. Globally, 49 million children under 5 were affected by wasting and another 40 million were overweight in 2018.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
86;Strengthening the resilience and adaptive capacity of small-scale and family farmers, whose productivity is systematically lower than all other food producers, is critical to reversing the trend of the rise in hunger. The share of small-scale food producers in terms of all food producers in countries in Africa, Asia and Latin America ranges from 40 to 85 per cent, compared with fewer than 10 per cent in Europe.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
87;The proportion of undernourished people worldwide increased from 10.6 per cent in 2015 to 11.0 per cent in 2016. This translates to 815 million people worldwide in 2016, up from 777 million in 2015.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
88;In 2017, 151 million children under age 5 suffered from stunting (low height for their age), 51 million suffered from wasting (low weight for height), and 38 million were overweight.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
89;Aid to agriculture in developing countries totalled $12.5 billion in 2016, falling to 6 per cent of all donors’ sector-allocable aid from nearly 20 per cent in the mid-1980s.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
90;In 2016, 26 countries experienced high or moderately high levels of general food prices, which may have negatively affected food security.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
91;In 2016, an estimated 52 million children under 5 years of age worldwide suffered from wasting (with a low weight for their height, usually the result of an acute and significant food shortage and/or disease). The global wasting rate in 2016 was 7.7 per cent, with the highest rate (15.4 per cent) in Southern Asia. At the other end of the spectrum, overweight and obesity affected 41 million children under 5 years of age worldwide (6 per cent) in 2016.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
92;Ending hunger demands sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices. One aspect of that effort is maintaining the genetic diversity of plants and animals, which is crucial for agriculture and food production. In 2016, 4.7 million samples of seeds and other plant genetic material for food and agriculture were preserved in 602 gene banks throughout 82 countries and 14 regional and international centres — a 2 per cent increase since 2014. Animal genetic material has been cryoconserved, but only for 15 per cent of national breed populations, according to information obtained from 128 countries. The stored genetic material is sufficient to reconstitute only 7 per cent of national breed populations should they become extinct. As of February 2017, 20 per cent of local breeds were classified as at risk.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
93;Goal 2 aims to end hunger and all forms of malnutrition by 2030. It also commits to universal access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food at all times of the year. This will require sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices, equal access to land, technology and markets and international cooperation on investments in infrastructure and technology to boost agricultural productivity.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
94;In recent years, income poverty has been declining steadily in the Asia-Pacific region, but rural poverty remains widespread and deep, and continues to pose a serious challenge for policymakers. Improving agricultural productivity has been a core strategy for economic development and poverty alleviation for several decades, as this type of productivity was thought to facilitate structural transformation, which enables “surplus agricultural labour” to find employment in nonagricultural sectors. However, it has now been realized that the share of agriculture in national output declines more rapidly than the share of agricultural employment in total employment, trapping millions in “unproductive” agriculture and making them relatively poorer. Understanding this process and identifying appropriate responses is critical for poverty alleviation and inclusive growth. Based on data analysis and policy reviews, in the present paper, it has been found that structural transformation processes are incomplete in many developing countries. Reducing rural poverty and promoting inclusive growth cannot be realized by confining to agriculture, but instead they can be achieved by seeking a broader policy framework that facilitates enhanced intersectoral linkages.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
95;In the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Sustainable Development Goal 2 aims to end hunger, achieve food security, improve nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture. It is a comprehensive goal covering the four dimensions of food security (food availability, access, utilization and stability) and nutrition, and it requires the systematic monitoring of progress made towards the SDG 2 indicators to provide valuable and regular evidence to Member States, regional bodies and international organizations. FAO has committed to monitoring trends in food security and nutrition at global, regional and national levels, jointly with its partners, within the framework of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
96;Global food prices have more than doubled over the past decade, reaching unprecedented highs. Increased prices have made food less affordable to many and exposed deep structural flaws in the global food system. Meanwhile, the increase in food production necessary to meet the needs of a rapidly expanding population will—under current technologies and practices—lead to further environmental destruction in the form of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), water pollution, and land degradation.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
97;This chapter assesses the extent to which policies in six South East European (SEE) economies support competitiveness, innovation and structural change in agriculture. After an overview of the economic, social and environmental context of the agriculture sector, the chapter then focuses on four sub-dimensions. The first sub-dimension, agricultural policy, examines key policies and instruments focused on the agriculture sector – including domestic producer support, trade and tax. The second sub-dimension, agro-food system capacity, assesses rural infrastructure capacity, highlighting irrigation, labour mobility, skills and education. The third sub-dimension, agro-food system regulation, describes how well regulations for inputs and natural resources safeguard public safety and how burdensome it is for farmers to comply with them. The final sub-dimension, the agricultural innovation system, assesses the research and development frameworks to create new technologies and the extension services to support farmers in adopting them. The chapter includes suggestions for enhancing the policies in each of these sub-dimensions to enhance productivity and sustainability in their agriculture sectors, which in turn would foster the competitiveness of these economies.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
98;Although progress has been made, hunger and food insecurity are still key development challenges for Africa. While some 194 million people on the continent are severely food insecure, another 161 million are moderately food insecure. Countries in the Sahel and Southern Africa were particularly hit by severe droughts arising from the El Niño phenomenon, which were aggravated by the culmination of several disruptive events, including internal conflicts. The livelihoods of affected communities have been severely disrupted and have required food assistance. These challenges have had a significant impact on the region’s progress regarding acute malnutrition, undernourishment and food insecurity.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
99;Globally, almost 200 million children under 5 suffer from stunting, wasting, or both and at least 340 million from the hidden hunger of vitamin and mineral deficiencies. At the same time, 40 million children under 5 are overweight and the toll from overweight and obesity keeps rising, even in lower-income countries. These patterns reflect a profound triple burden of malnutrition that threatens the survival, growth and development of children and of nations.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
100;Much has changed since 1974, when FAO first began reporting on the extent of hunger in the world. The world population has grown steadily, with most people now living in urban areas. Technology has evolved at a dizzying pace, while the economy has become increasingly interconnected and globalized. All of this has led to major shifts in the way in which food is produced, distributed and consumed worldwide. But these transformations have also brought about worrying developments in malnutrition. Although the prevalence of child stunting has decreased significantly over the past 20 years, overweight and obesity, and diet-related non-communicable diseases, are rapidly on the rise.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
101;Globalization, urbanization, climate shocks and emergencies are worsening the nutritional prospects of millions of poor and excluded children. For many, lack of access to nutritious, safe, affordable and sustainable food is compounded by the threat of disease from poor water and sanitation. We need a nutrition transformation to ensure these children get the chance to fulfil their potential and to help end the flow of poverty across generations.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
102;The evolving nature of global child malnutrition demands a new response: one that can deliver nutrition-specific interventions and nutrition-sensitive development in a more coordinated fashion. The response must acknowledge the central role and responsibility of the food system, and work together with the health, water and sanitation, education and social protection systems to provide better diets for children.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
103;Despite earlier extended progress, the number of people suffering from hunger has been on the rise since 2014. Stunting affects the growth and cognitive development of millions of children, while the prevalence of overweight—the other face of malnutrition— is increasing in all age groups. In the wake of conflicts, climateinduced shocks and economic slowdowns worldwide, intensified efforts are needed to implement and scale up interventions to improve access to safe, nutritious and sufficient food for all. Specifically, attention needs to be given to increasing the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers, implementing resilient agricultural practices, and ensuring the proper functioning of markets. Finally, in ensuring that no one is left behind on the road towards zero hunger, the intergenerational cycle of malnutrition must be broken.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
104;Despite impressive progress in reducing hunger and poverty, about 800 million people worldwide continue to suffer from undernourishment. Food insecurity and malnutrition are problems affecting rural areas in particular, as part of a pattern of deep-rooted spatial inequalities. Conventional sectoral agriculture and food policies often overlook such territorial disparities and, consequently, are unlikely to suffice to meet the sustainable development goal of ending hunger and achieving food security for all by 2030. This chapter argues that food security and nutrition policies would greatly benefit from a territorial approach. A territorial approach to food security and nutrition goes beyond a simple rural-urban dichotomy. The development of strong and mutually reinforcing rural-urban linkages is important for the development of agriculture and food systems at large, but will not be effective if it does not consider competing uses for land, water and other natural resources and plans infrastructure and basic services within and between different territorial contexts.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
105;"The eradication of hunger and all forms of malnutrition is central to the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). SDG 2 focuses specifically on ending hunger, achieving food security, improving nutrition and promoting sustainable agriculture by 2030. Attaining Zero Hunger implies leaving no-one behind regarding hunger and all forms of malnutrition. Achieving the Zero Hunger vision under Agenda 2030 requires food systems that are economically efficient, socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable. To ensure that everyone has access to sufficient nutritious food today and tomorrow, requires widespread promotion of sustainable agriculture and conservation of biodiversity; enhanced livelihoods of smallholder farmers, including fishers, foresters and pastoralists; and increased investment in agriculture, markets, agribusinesses and related infrastructures.";;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
106;This chapter presents medium-term projections for markets and production of agricultural and fisheries commodities important for the ten Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) members, including the implications of these projections for future food security. It also considers longer-term issues for agriculture and food security in the region, related to the possible impacts of climate change. To this end, it first explores projections of prices, production and trade of key regional agricultural and fisheries commodities. Second, it analyses the impacts of these medium-term projections on regional food security within ASEAN. Third, it considers some of the longer term implications of climate change on agriculture and food security.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
107;Childhood malnutrition remains a significant global health concern. In order to implement effective policies to address the issue, it is crucial to first understand the mechanisms underlying malnutrition. This paper uses a unique dataset from Northern Ghana to explain the underlying causes of childhood malnutrition. It adopts an empirical framework to model inputs in the production of health and nutrition, as a function of child, household and community characteristics. The findings suggest that child characteristics are important in explaining inputs and nutritional outcomes, and that maternal agency and health contribute to improved health status. Household resources in the form of consumption are positively associated with food intake and nutritional outcomes. Simulations show that income growth, improving maternal care and avoiding sudden price shocks have a positive but rather limited effect on the reduction of malnutrition. Effects are greater in children under two. Hence, policies that address underlying determinants simultaneously, and target the youngest population of children, could have the largest effect on reducing malnutrition in this population.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
108;This chapter takes stock of agricultural innovation systems (AIS) in Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) member states, using the OECD framework for Analysing Policies to Improve Agricultural Productivity Growth, Sustainably. It assesses governance of the AIS in ASEAN, investments in innovation, institutions for facilitating knowledge flows in the AIS, and systems for cross-country co-operation on innovation within the region. The chapter concludes with recommendations for promoting sustainable agricultural productivity growth across the region by improving the enabling environment and innovation systems in ASEAN.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
109;Goal 2 addresses a fundamental human need—access to nutritious, healthy food—and the means by which it can be sustainably secured for everyone. Tackling hunger cannot be addressed solely by increasing food production. Well-functioning markets, increased incomes for smallholder farmers, equal access to technology and land, and additional investments all play a role in creating a vibrant and productive agricultural sector that builds food security.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
110;"In politics, humanitarian aid, and social science, hunger is a condition in which a person, for a sustained period, is unable to eat sufficient food to meet basic nutritional needs. So in the field of hunger relief, the term hunger is used in a sense that goes beyond the common desire for food that all humans experience.\nThroughout history, portions of the world\'s population have often suffered sustained periods of hunger. In many cases, hunger resulted from food supply disruptions caused by war, plagues, or adverse weather. In the decades following World War II, technological progress and enhanced political cooperation suggested it might be possible to substantially reduce the number of people suffering from hunger. While progress was uneven, by 2015 the threat of extreme hunger subsided for many of the world\'s population. According to figures published by the FAO in 2019 however, the number of people suffering from chronic hunger has been increasing over the last four years.  This is both as a percentage of the world\'s population, and in absolute terms, with about 821 million afflicted with hunger in 2018.\nWhile most of the world\'s hungry people continue to live in Asia, much of the increase in hunger since 2015 occurred in Africa and South America. The FAO\'s 2017 report discussed three principal reasons for the recent increase in hunger: climate, conflict, and economic slowdowns. The 2018 report focused on extreme weather as a primary driver of the increase in hunger, finding rises were especially severe in countries where the agricultural systems were most sensitive to extreme variations in weather. While the FAO\'s 2019 report found there was also a strong correlation between increases in hunger and countries that had suffered an economic slowdown.\nMany thousands of organisations are engaged in the field of hunger relief;  operating at local, national, regional or international levels. Some of these organisations are dedicated to hunger relief, while others may work in a number of different fields. The organisations range from multilateral institutions, to national governments, to small local initiatives such as independent soup kitchens. Many participate in umbrella networks that connect together thousands of different hunger relief organisations. At the global level, much of the world\'s hunger relief efforts are coordinated by the UN, and geared towards achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal for ""Zero hunger""";;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
111;1 2017 HLPF Thematic review of SDG2: End hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition, and promote sustainable agriculture1 1. Status of progress on SDG 2 i. Overview SDG2 highlights the complex inter-linkages between food security, nutrition, rural transformation and sustainable agriculture. SDG2 links the eradication of hunger and of malnutrition to a transformation in agriculture and food systems, and to the empowerment of rural people, women and men alike, as critical agents of change. Agriculture plays a key and direct role in achieving SDG2, but it is also central to achieving SDG1 on eradicating extreme poverty, and several other targets, especially those related to health, water, biodiversity, sustainable cities, sustainable energy, and climate change. SDG2 and SDG1 are intrinsically linked. Over 70% of the world’s extreme poor live in rural areas. They rely on agriculture as their main source of living, struggle to access productive resources, and are highly vulnerable to climate and other shocks.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
112;"They are often the first victims of natural resources degradation, and are impacted by crisis more severely than any other segment of the population. The world is facing an unprecedented number of protracted crises, where progress to end poverty and food insecurity is threatened or reversed, and where prolonged, targeted support is needed to address immediate needs as well as to enhance the resilience of populations and ecosystems. Achieving the “zero hunger” vision under Agenda 2030 also requires social protection and food systems that are economically efficient, socially inclusive, and environmentally sustainable. To ensure that everyone has access to sufficient nutritious food today and tomorrow, requires widespread promotion of sustainable agriculture and conservation of biodiversity; enhanced livelihoods of smallholder farmers, including fishers, foresters and pastoralists; and increased investments in agriculture, markets, agribusinesses and related infrastructures. In a context of rapid urbanization, accelerating efforts around SDG1 and SDG2 also requires efforts to improve urban-rural linkages through investments in food systems capable of supplying urban 1 This background note has been developed by members of ECESA Plus as a voluntary and coordinated contribution by the UN system to the 2017 HLPF in depth review of SDG 2.";;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

Current situation and lessons learned Countries are following diverse pathways to “domesticate” the SDGs. The strong interlinkage between goals and targets presents challenges which many governments are addressing through the establishment of national platforms for developing more integrated programmes and policies. Surveys conducted in early 2017 by DOCO and FAO among others indicate that countries are advancing quickly in the process of selecting national targets under the SDGs. Coordination bodies have been established in most countries, and, in LDCs, local UN offices are providing substantial support to the SDG assessment and implementation processes.t measures with equivalent effect, in accordance with the mandate of the Doha Development Round 2.c. adopt measures to ensure the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives, and facilitate timely access to market information, including on food reserves, in order to help limit extreme food price volatility;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
114;An important follow-up action has been the decision of the UN General Assembly to declare 2016- 2025 the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition. The Nutrition Decade capitalizes on the clarion call of targets 2.1 and 2.2 of the 2030 Agenda, and affords an unprecedented opportunity for commitments to accelerate evidence-based action at all levels, enhance collaboration across all stakeholders, and to improve monitoring and shared learning for achieving the nutrition-related SDG targets. The Committee on World Food Security (CFS) has also developed policy products aimed at supporting countries in achieving SDG2 (and others) through cross cutting and comprehensive policies related to food security, nutrition and sustainable agriculture. The surveys also indicate that countries are experiencing difficulties in addressing the interactions between SDG2 and other goals and targets. A key risk is that sectoral perspectives could undermine the holistic and integrated development vision of the 2030 Agenda and lead to business-as-usual. There is also a need to further strengthen national capacities for food security assessments, statistical capacity and data generation/collection for decision-making. Greater effort may be required of partners supporting governments to ensure that planners recognize the large contribution SDG2 targets can make to a variety of national objectives.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
115;Despite important progress, the current pace and scope of implementation is unlikely to promote the transformational change needed to realize the objectives of SDG2. According to the most recent data and analysis presented in the State of Food Insecurity in the World (SOFI) 2015, if current trends continue, SDG2 targets will not be achieved in many parts of the world. Large segments of the world’s population, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia, will remain under- or malnourished by 2030 and even by 2050. Similarly, the proportion and number of children affected by stunting are decreasing but not fast enough, particularly in Africa, in order to attain the World Health Assembly’s global target of a 40 percent reduction in the number of stunted children by 2025. Estimates published in the Lancet earlier this year indicate that improving rates of breastfeeding could prevent 820,000 child deaths each year. Breastfeeding decreases the prevalence of overweight or obesity later in life by 26%. In 2015 global child stunting, wasting and overweight rates were 23% (164 million), 7.4% (50 million) and 6.2% (42 million). 3 At the same time, on current trends, the number of children affected by overweight will continue to increase rapidly, putting considerable burden on development and health efforts.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
116;Greater efforts are also required to ensure agricultural producers, especially women, have access to land, finance, technology, markets, information and other means of implementation necessary to implement sustainable agricultural practices and improve livelihoods, incomes and resilience. The 2030 Agenda recognizes peace is a fundamental condition for sustainable development and the eradication of hunger. The humanitarian system currently faces the prospect of responding to four conflict-induced famines, while also facing protracted crises and mass population movements. While the four contexts are distinctive and unrelated, there are some commonalities: persistent conflict and drought are among the principal drivers of food insecurity. Conflict is the major cause of the historically unprecedented levels of humanitarian need in the world today. More than 125 million people are currently directly affected by humanitarian crises, over 65 million are displaced by conflict, out of which 21 million are refugees, 41 million internally displaced, 3 million seeking asylum.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
117;In addition, each year an average of 25 million people flee natural disasters. Impacts of such massive displacement reverberate strongly across the globe. Addressing the root causes of conflict, especially by ensuring secure access to land and water, as well as other essential services, is crucial for establishing the durable conditions for peace. Protracted crises call for specially designed and targeted assistance that addresses the immediate need to save lives and alleviate suffering by meeting survival needs, while also boosting resilience and the capacity to absorb, prepare for, and prevent crises. . To ensure no-one is left behind, greater collaboration between development and humanitarian actors in pursuit of these collective outcomes is required. Improving resource mobilization and allocation is crucial for effective implementation of the portfolio of policies, instruments and programmes that are needed to achieve SDG 2. The resources and tools currently available are not adequate for meeting the long-term needs of the poor and vulnerable populations. FAO, IFAD and WFP estimated in 2015 that additional annual investment of USD 265 billion is needed to defeat extreme poverty and hunger by 2030, as compared to a “business as usual” scenario. This amount includes investment in both social protection programmes (USD 67 billion) and pro-poor productive activities (USD 198 billion).;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
118;While middle income countries can mobilize these investments out of their own resources, low-income countries will require assistance. There is also need for the international community to invest more in recovery from disasters and conflicts, and in the financing of risk reduction, and address the drivers of vulnerability and risk. Robust, accountable multi-stakeholder platforms and partnerships are needed to support holistic, well-balanced approaches to achieving the SDG2 and related targets. Enhanced governance and multi-stakeholder coordination mechanisms should include inter-sectoral dialogue and support institutional development that incentivizes stakeholders to work together to develop common solutions towards shared objectives. These multi-stakeholder mechanisms can also be used to identify and mobilize the capacities, information, technologies, financial requirements and access to 4 productive resources that are needed to implement and sustain the agreed strategies. UN institutions can play a unique role as a trusted and neutral facilitator that provides and upholds inter-governmentally agreed norms and standards, monitors commitments and tracks results, and promotes institutional adaptation and strengthening. SDG2 monitoring at country level offers opportunities to focus efforts at country level, and to inform and shape policy processes. Preliminary analysis of country experiences show that many countries are focusing their attention on monitoring and reporting and are asking for support in adapting their statistical capacity to the new challenges. Regular national assessments using the new indicators can help direct attention to the policy adjustments and associated programmes that are needed to achieve the 2030 Agenda.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
119;This shows the potential power of regular, timely and expanded measurement under the SDGs to contribute to transformational change. Some SDG 2 indicators are relatively well established, such as for food security and nutrition, but more accelerated efforts need to be made to develop and apply cost-effective monitoring and reporting methods for others, especially for smallholder income and productivity, and sustainable agriculture. 2. SDG2 implementation - Progress on targets2 Target 2.1 Ending hunger The proportion of undernourished (hungry) people in the world, as measured by the prevalence of undernourishment (POU) indicator, declined from 15 per cent in 2000-2002 to 11 per cent in 2014- 2016, but more than 790 million people worldwide still suffer from hunger. Another measure, the Food Insecurity Experience Scale (FIES) provides estimates about the adequacy of people´s access to food. The FIES snapshot in 2015 shows that 1 in 5 people in the world is experiencing moderate or severe food insecurity, of whom approximately 650 million – 1 in 11 – suffer from severe food insecurity. Food insecurity rates appear to be slightly higher among women than men. People in conflict affected states are up to three times more likely to be undernourished than those who are living in more stable developing countries.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
120;Harmful effects of climate change as well as persistent political instability and conflict result in increased food insecurity and malnutrition. Africa suffers from the highest levels of food insecurity, with close to half the population experiencing moderate or severe levels of food insecurity and more than one in five reporting experiences that indicate a condition of severe food insecurity. Without dedicated efforts to improve access to food, including through inclusive governance and shock- responsive social protection systems, climate and conflict risks could undermine global progress in achieving SDG2. Target 2.2 Ending all forms of malnutrition Globally in 2016, 7.7% or 51.7 million of children under five years old were wasted (weight-for- height below -2 SD of the WHO child growth standards median). This prevalence indicates that the 2 See Annex I for SDG2 targets 5 World is not meeting the global target, which is to reduce and maintain wasting below 5%. In Asia, 9.9% of children (or almost 36 million) are wasted. In Africa, 7.4% (or 14 million) are wasted. Child stunting portrays linear growth and measures long-term growth faltering. If current trends continue, there will be 130 million stunted children by 2025, about 30 million above the global target, which is 40% reduction in numbers of stunted children compared to a baseline of 165 million in 2012.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
121;"Currently, 59 million children that are stunted live in Africa, 87 million in Asia, 6 million in Latin America, and the remaining 3 million in Oceania and developed countries. Obesity in adults nearly doubled between 1980 and 2014; in 2014 11% of men and 15% of women were obese. The prevalence of overweight and obesity is rising rapidly particularly in low- and middle-income countries, with a small difference between the richest and poorest in most countries. Most overweight children under 5 live in low- and middle-income countries, and the increase in overweight prevalence extends to adults, with maternal overweight reaching more than 80 percent in some high-burden countries. Target 2.3 Doubling productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers Small farms produce a significant proportion of the food in the world. Although global numbers on this contribution are not readily available, numbers from household surveys for about 20 developing countries indicate that small farms run by families may produce above 60 or even 70 percent of the food produced in these countries. Many small farmers and their households are themselves poor and food insecure, at risk of malnutrition, with limited access to markets and to productive assets and services.";;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
122;They are vulnerable to shocks and their economic choices are highly constrained. Tackling the multiple challenge of producing more food, in term of quantity, diversity and quality, creating more remunerative work, reducing rural poverty, enhancing food security and nutrition and preserving the natural resource base should therefore consider small family farmers, with a particular focus on women, as key targets in agriculture policies. Yet, in many cases agriculture policies do not differentiate between different types of farmers and, by focusing on production targets, tend to favour larger holdings. Available evidence is limited, and urgent, scaled- up action is required to characterize small and medium producers. More work is also needed to produce comprehensive data on small-scale food producers’ agricultural productivity, livelihoods, market activities, and use of natural resources, especially in the poorest areas. Disaggregation by gender should be a priority. Target 2.4 Sustainable food production systems and resilient agricultural practices Agriculture occupies more than one-third of land in most countries of the world and is a major consumer of biodiversity, but if managed sustainably agriculture can also contribute to important 6 ecosystem functions. These include climate change resilience and mitigation, maintenance of water quality, erosion control, biological pest control and pollination.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
123;However, today, 33 percent of land is moderately to highly degraded, and conditions are getting worse in far more cases than they are improving. An estimated two-thirds of the global population – over 4 billion people – live in areas with severe water shortages for at least one month each year, and a growing number of regions are facing water scarcity due to excessive water use in agriculture. Groundwater is being depleted, polluted, or salinized in ways disproportionately affecting the poor and vulnerable. The global extent of wetlands is estimated to have declined between 64-71% in the 20th century, and wetland losses and degradation continue worldwide. Agricultural greenhouse gas emissions from crop and livestock production grew by 14 percent between 2001 and 2011. It is estimated that 20-25 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions are directly caused by agriculture, including deforestation. In return, higher temperature and increased climate variability and weather-related disasters affect agriculture and threaten the stability of food prices. Smallholder farmers in developing countries are the most at risk, as their sensitivity to extreme events is usually low. In its 2014 Assessment, the IPCC estimates that climate change could increase the risk of hunger and malnutrition by up to 20 percent by 2050.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
124;The likelihood of increased variability and extreme events means that management of risk, both locally and internationally, is crucial. The Paris Agreement highlights the need to enhance early warning systems, emergency preparedness, measures to address slow-onset events, comprehensive risk assessment and management, climate risk insurance, and the resilience of communities, livelihoods and ecosystems. Partnerships and knowledge sharing are critical to drive positive change. Countries are progressively integrating principles of sustainability in their agriculture policies and programmes. The 2030 Agenda offers line agencies an opportunity to look at agriculture through the lens of the multiple economic, social and environmental functions it performs, and to develop tools and incentives that balance trade-offs between the different dimensions of sustainability. Better tools and evidence are urgently needed to monitor progress towards sustainable agriculture and resilient food systems. Target 2.5 Maintaining genetic diversity Biodiversity is key to food security and nutrition, and to ensuring sustainable increases in agricultural production. Genetic resources provide the material for selection on higher productivity and lower use of chemical inputs, resulting in less depletion of natural resources. It is particularly important as a tool for adaptation of food production to climate change, including higher temperatures, less water, increased salinity, etc. The differences in nutrient content between species and varieties can be used to fight malnutrition, including micronutrient deficiencies.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
125;The CBD’s Cancun Declaration (2016) expresses concern over the negative impacts on biodiversity caused by degradation and fragmentation of ecosystems, unsustainable land use changes, overexploitation of natural resources, illegal harvesting and trade of species, introduction of invasive alien species, pollution of air, soil, inland waters and oceans, climate change and desertification. Parties committed to mainstreaming of biodiversity across agricultural sectors. 7 SDG target 2.5 focuses on 3 issues: maintaining genetic diversity for food and agriculture through sustainable use and development/breeding, conservation in case the resources are no longer used, and ensuring access and benefit sharing. The indicator for plant genetic resources addresses the state of ex-situ conservation, which is most easy to measure because of well-documented genebanks, and assumes that genebanks are a sufficient representation of the diversity found in farmers’ fields. At the end of 2016, seeds and other planting materials of 4.7 million accessions of plant genetic resources for food and agriculture (PGRFA), including cultivars and crop wild relatives (CWR), were conserved in 602 genebanks of 82 countries and 14 regional and international centres.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
126;"Increases occurred in all the regions, with the highest in accessions being in Africa and the Oceania. However, significant scope for safeguarding CWR and enhancing the required national capacities still remain especially as their natural habitats are increasingly under threat. For animal genetic resources, the risk status of reported breed populations in the field is assessed in the indicator. As of February 2017, across the world, when excluding extinct breeds, 20% of breeds occurring in only one country are classified as at-risk, 13% as not at-risk; and 67% of unknown status. With the exception of Northern America and Europe, the risk status of at least 86% of local breeds is considered to be unknown. Compared to the results from 2016, the percentage of breeds with unknown risk status increased in 2017 (65% in 2016) while the percentage of breed not at risk decreased (16% in 2016) and the percentage of breeds at risk remained stable.";;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
127;The high degree of uncertainty in these results show the urgent need for improved collection of national livestock census data on breed level. Target 2.a Increasing investments Accelerated growth in the agricultural and rural economies is essential for breaking the vicious cycle of extreme poverty, undernourishment and malnutrition. Economic development and public investment in agriculture are highly correlated. Those parts of the world where agricultural capital per worker and public investments in agriculture have stagnated are the centres of extreme poverty and hunger today. Farmers are the largest investors in agriculture in developing countries and must be central to any strategy for increasing investment in the sector, but if they are to invest more in agriculture they need a supportive policy environment based on economic incentives and ancillary public and private investments in infrastructure, market development, and essential services. Public sector expenditures are essential to address market failures and encourage development of the productive capacities of the agricultural and rural households. Yet, the gap between agriculture’s contribution to the economy and its share of government expenditures is increasing: the agriculture orientation index (AOI) – which measures agriculture’s share of government expenditures relative to its share of GDP —;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
128;"fell from 0.38 in 2001 to 0.24 in 2013 and 0.21 in 2015 worldwide. For the 2013-2015 period, the AOI was highest in North America and Europe (0.39), followed by Western Asia and Northern Africa (0.38) and Eastern and South- eastern Asia (0.37); and lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa (0.17) and Latin America and the Caribbean (0.15). 8 The widening gap between agriculture’s contribution to the economy and its share of government expenditures cannot be offset by increasing ODA. Though Total Official Flows (TOFs) (official development assistance plus other official flows) to the agriculture sector has substantially increased in both relative and absolute terms between 2006 and 2015, the increase, USD 5 billion, cannot offset the decline in national expenditure in agriculture. The upward trend of allocating TOFs to agriculture reflects increasing recognition of the critical role agriculture can play as an engine for sustainable development, consequently achieving SGDs.";;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
129;Target 2.b Correcting and preventing trade restrictions and distortions WTO decided to eliminate export subsidy for agricultural commodities at its 10th Ministerial Conference in Nairobi in December 2015. The decision calls for abolishing of all sorts of export subsidies, including export credit, export credit guarantees, or insurance programs for agricultural products. Estimates on agricultural producer support as a measure of protection reveals a slow move towards less support to agriculture, paving the way for a levelling of global agricultural trade. Taking the case of EU (28 countries) and the USA, agricultural producer support has declined sharply from an average of 27.77% of gross farm receipts in 2000 to as low as 14.18% in 2015. Target 2.c Ensuring the proper functioning of food commodity markets and their derivatives Improved functioning of markets through better monitoring systems and improved access to market and commodity related information is being addressed through strengthening of existing tools and better dissemination of information available. This includes WTO monitoring and mandatory notifications on domestic support, complemented by policy analysis and information collection on policy environments conducive to improved market functioning.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
130;"Monitoring of food prices is provided by publicly available sources including: food price index (FAO-FPI) monitoring prices monthly, with trends analysed biannually by the Food Outlook publication; reporting on food import bills is provided quarterly by the Crop Prospects and Food Situation publication; and quarterly WFP Global Market Monitor reporting on price trends of staple commodities in approximately 70 countries and monthly country specific market bulletins. The GIEWS Food Price Monitoring and Analysis (FPMA) provides analysis of domestic price trends of basic foods at global level and latest food market policy developments as well as early warnings on exceptionally high food prices at country level that may negatively affect food security. The G20 Agricultural Market Information System (AMIS), provides regular market updates an online Indicator Portal and extensive market and Policy Database and brings together the stakeholders to identify timely solutions. T";;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
131;hese combined measures allow countries to timely identify threats and address problems with the support of the international community. It is important to ensure that these actions are sustained and strengthened, and that measures are taken to enhance the accessibility and usability of such information by policy makers and by small farmers themselves.     9 3. Key Findings and Recommendations \uf0b7 Efforts to end hunger and malnutrition must be accelerated. While the percentage of people suffering from hunger is declining, their total number – nearly 800 million people -- remains unacceptably high. Progress in reducing child stunting, estimated at 165 million in 2012, must be accelerated and efforts to address obesity in adults, which nearly doubled between 1980 and 2014, represents a significant public health concern. \uf0b7 Progress towards sustainable agriculture – a key and integral component of SDG2 alongside eradicating hunger and nutrition – is slow and uneven.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
132;Climate change and unsustainable agricultural practices are increasing the exposure and vulnerability of small-scale food producers to extreme weather events, such as those associated with the 2016 El Niño. Building sustainable agriculture systems, that account for these heightened risks, needs to be a higher priority. \uf0b7 In recent months, severe food insecurity due to different combinations of environmental stressors, conflict, displacement, and competition over scarce natural resources has affected many millions of women and men. This constitutes today (April 2017) a major humanitarian challenge confronting the international community that requires urgent attention. \uf0b7 Countries are following diverse pathways to implement policies and programmes to achieve SDG2. The strong interlinkage between SDG2 and related goals and targets presents challenges which many governments are addressing through the establishment of national platforms for developing more integrated policies and programmes.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
133;The international community should continue to encourage these efforts and provide space to exchange knowledge and foster productive partnerships. \uf0b7 There have been encouraging policy developments at the global level relating to SDG2 in the past year – including in the context of the G20, G7 and the UNFCCC – which should be further built upon. The launch of the UN Decade of Action on Nutrition and the ongoing work of the Committee on World Food Security to promote policy convergence and coordination of efforts around both SDG2 and some of its major enablers, are also important and encouraging. \uf0b7 Despite these developments, the current pace and scope of implementation of policy and investment initiatives are unlikely to achieve SDG2 and other related aspects of the 2030 Agenda. The transformational change needed to realize the “zero hunger” vision of SDG2 rests on creating food systems that are more efficient, sustainable and resilient, as well as more inclusive – of women, youth, small-scale food producers, and people living in poverty.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
134;\uf0b7 In particular, progress on mobilizing means of implementation for SDG2 and related provisions in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, especially investment in sustainable and inclusive agriculture to reduce poverty and food insecurity, remains insufficient and needs to be urgently addressed. \uf0b7 More effective use of inclusive, including gender-inclusive, multi-stakeholder platforms and partnerships are needed to support holistic, well-balanced approaches to achieving SDG2 and its related targets. \uf0b7 SDG2 monitoring and reporting are high on the agenda of many member states. The follow up and review process should be seen as an opportunity for governments and partners to inform and shape policy processes, share evidence on best practices and lessons learned, and concentrate efforts on proven solutions, and deserves to be supported.;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

150;An estimated 303,000 women around the world died due to complications of pregnancy and childbirth in 2015. Almost all of these deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries, and almost two thirds of those were in sub-Saharan Africa. These deaths are preventable with appropriate management and care. Globally in 2018, 81 per cent of births took place with the assistance of a skilled birth attendant, a significant improvement from 69 per cent in 2012. Coverage of skilled birth attendants in 2018 was only 59 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
151;Immunization saves millions of lives and is widely recognized as one of the world’s most successful and cost-effective health interventions. Coverage of the required three doses of the vaccine that prevents diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis increased from 72 per cent in 2000 to 85 per cent in 2015 and has remained unchanged between 2015 and 2017. An estimated 19.9 million children did not receive the vaccines during the first year of life, putting them at serious risk of these potentially fatal diseases. The global coverage of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine, which has the potential to significantly reduce deaths in children under age of 5, has yet to reach 50 per cent. Two doses of the measles vaccine are required to prevent the disease and the illnesses, disabilities and deaths caused by complications associated with it. Coverage with the second dose of measles vaccine increased from 59 per cent in 2015 to 67 per cent in 2017, but that is still insufficient to prevent this highly contagious disease.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
152;Expanding access to modern contraceptive methods is essential to ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services. Globally, the proportion of women of reproductive age (15 to 49 years old) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern contraceptive methods has continued to increase slowly, from 74 per cent in 2000 to 76 per cent in 2019.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
153;Strong and steady domestic and international commitment and funding has fuelled an acceleration of evidence-informed HIV prevention, testing and treatment programmes. As a result, the incidence of HIV in sub-Saharan Africa (among adults aged 15 to 49) has declined by 37 per cent, from 3.39 infections per 1,000 uninfected people in 2010 to 2.49 in 2015 and 2.14 in 2017. However, the rate of global HIV incidence among adults aged 15 to 49 declined from 0.44 to 0.40 between 2015 and 2017 and overall by 22 per cent between 2010 and 2017, well short of the declines required to meet 2020 and 2030 targets.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
154;"Tuberculosis remains a leading cause of ill health and death. In 2017, an estimated 10 million people fell ill with tuberculosis. The burden is falling globally: incidence of tuberculosis has continued to decline from 170 new and relapse cases per 100,000 people in 2000 to 140 in 2015, and 134 in 2017; and the tuberculosis mortality rate among HIV-negative people fell by 42 per cent between 2000 and 2017. However, large gaps in detection and treatment persist and the current pace of progress is not fast enough to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target, with drug-resistant tuberculosis remaining a continuing threat.";;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
155;After more than a decade of steady advances in fighting malaria, progress has stalled.  No significant gains were made in reducing the number of malaria cases worldwide in the period 2015–2017. Sub-Saharan Africa continues to carry the heaviest burden of disease, accounting for more than 90 per cent of the global malaria burden. Worryingly, there were an estimated 3.5 million more malaria cases in the 10 highest-burden African countries in 2017 compared with the previous year.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
156;In 2015, an estimated 325 million people worldwide were living with hepatitis B virus or hepatitis C virus infection. The widespread use of hepatitis B vaccine in infants has considerably reduced the incidence of new chronic HBV infections, as reflected by the decline in hepatitis B prevalence among children under 5 years of age, from 4.7 per cent in the pre-vaccine era to 0.8 per cent in 2017.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
157;In 2017, 1.58 billion people were reported as requiring mass or individual treatment and care for neglected tropical diseases, down from 1.63 billion in 2015 and 2.03 billion in 2010. Improved surveillance meant that further populations requiring interventions against such diseases were identified in 2017. The 522 million people requiring treatment and care in least developed countries represented 52 per cent of those countries’ populations, down from 584 million in 2015.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
158;The probability of dying from any of the four main non-communicable diseases – cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes – between the ages of 30 and 70 was 18 per cent in 2016. The risk remains markedly higher for men globally, at 21.6 per cent, compared with 15 per cent for women.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
159;Progress has been made in reducing the global suicide rate (from 12.9 per 100,000 in 2000 to 10.6 per 100,000 in 2016). However, suicide remains the second-highest cause of death among people aged 15 to 29 globally, with 79 per cent of suicides found in low- and middle-income countries in 2016.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
160;The prevalence of tobacco use declined from 27 per cent in 2000 to 20 per cent in 2016. Prevalence fell faster for women, from 11 per cent in 2000 to 6 per cent in 2016, compared with men: prevalence in men only fell from 43 per cent to 34 per cent. Despite the positive trends, the number of people dying from a tobacco-related illness was estimated to be more than 8.1 million in 2017.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
161;The number of road traffic deaths climbed from 1.31 million in 2013 to 1.35 million in 2016. Road traffic injury is the leading cause of death for children and young adults aged 5 to 29.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
162;Air pollution, both ambient and household, increases the risk of cardiovascular and respiratory disease and, in 2016, led to some 7 million deaths worldwide. Sub-Saharan Africa and most of Asia and Oceania (excluding Australia/New Zealand) have the highest mortality rates associated with air pollution, as a large proportion of the population still rely on polluting fuels and technologies for cooking.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
163;Inadequate and unsafe drinking water, sanitation and hygiene is linked to 60 per cent of the disease burden from diarrhoea, 100 per cent of the burden from infections with soil-transmitted helminths and 16 per cent of the burden from protein-energy malnutrition, leading to a total of 870,000 deaths in 2016 from the three conditions.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
164;Health is a state of physical, mental and social well-being in which disease and infirmity are absent;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
165;"Well-being, wellbeing, or wellness is the condition of an individual or group. A higher level of well-being means that in some sense the individual\'s or group\'s condition is more positive. According to Naci and Ioannidis, ""Wellness refers to diverse and interconnected dimensions of physical, mental, and social well-being that extend beyond the traditional definition of health. It includes choices and activities aimed at achieving physical vitality, mental alacrity, social satisfaction, a sense of accomplishment, and personal fulfillment""";;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
166;"Goal 3 seeks to ensure health and well-being for all at every stage of life. The aim is to improve reproductive and maternal and child health; end the epidemics of HIV/AIDS, malaria, tuberculosis and neglected tropical diseases; reduce non-communicable and environmental diseases; achieve universal health coverage; and ensure universal access to safe, affordable and effective medicines and vaccines. Towards that end, world leaders committed to support research and development, increase health financing, and strengthen the capacity of all countries to reduce and manage health risks.";;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
167;Major progress has been made in improving the health of millions of people. Maternal and child mortality rates have been reduced, life expectancy continues to increase globally, and the fight against some infectious diseases has made steady progress. In the case of other diseases, however, progress has slowed or stalled, including global efforts to eradicate malaria and tuberculosis. Far too many deaths occurred because trained health workers or routine interventions, such as immunizations, were not available. In fact, at least half the world’s population, many of whom suffer financial hardship, are still without access to essential health services. In rich and poor countries alike, a health emergency can push people into bankruptcy or poverty.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
168;Over the past 15 years, reproductive, maternal and child health have improved greatly. The incidence of communicable diseases has declined, as have premature deaths from non-communicable diseases. Health services have been upgraded through better maternal and reproductive care, targeted disease elimination and control programmes, including broader treatment and vaccination coverage, and increased funding to support medical research and basic health in developing countries. To meet the 2030 targets, however, these interventions need to be expanded, particularly in regions with the highest burden of disease.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
169;Compared to the OECD average, the Korean population is relatively young and rate of behavioural risk factors relatively low. The system has, up until now, been focused on curative, rather than preventive care. However, rapid demographic shift, emerging risk factors linked to lifestyle, and an increasing burden of chronic diseases mean that prevention and public health should be a decisive policy priority sooner rather than later. The proportion of frail elderly is still low compared to OECD peers, with just 13.8% of the population over 65, and 3.0% over 80, in 2017. But Korea’s population is aging very rapidly, and by 2050 Korea is projected to have the largest over-65 population in the OECD, with 38% of people aged 65 years or over up from 13.8% in 2017, and 15.1% of the population 80 or over, up from 3.0% in 2017. While alcohol consumption and tobacco use are both slightly below the OECD average, and adult obesity is well below the OECD average, men are both heavy smokers and drinkers and child obesity rates are above the OECD average.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
170;Recent disasters and infectious diseases outbreaks have led Korea to reconsider the importance of its preparedness for public health emergencies. This chapter looks at how Korea sets-up and implements public health emergency policies and at how it builds the resilience of its health system, in accordance with the OECD Recommendation on the Governance of Critical Risks and other international guidelines. The chapter suggests that despite the usefulness of policy reforms and new capabilities, strengthening emergency preparedness in Korea remains an unfinished agenda, and more work is needed to address some key areas of weakness.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
171;This paper investigates the effects of health-care expenditures on child mortality rates using a simultaneous-equation model for 93 developed and developing countries with data spanning the period 1995–2012. The findings show that health expenditure has a positive effect on reducing child mortality only for upper-middle-income and high-income countries, whereas for low-income and lower-middle-income countries, health spending does not have a significant impact on child health status. It is also found that at lower development levels, public health spending has a greater effect on mortality rates than private expenditure, while at high development levels private health expenditure has a positive impact on child mortality.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
172;Telemedicine is being used across OECD countries to deliver health care in a wide range of specialties, for numerous conditions and through varied means. A growing body of evidence suggests that care delivered via telemedicine can be both safe and effective, in some cases with better outcomes than conventional face-to-face care. Telemedicine services can also be cost-effective in different settings and contexts. However, despite these benefits, these services still represent a small fraction of all health care activity and spending. Important barriers to wider use remain, with providers and patients facing regulatory uncertainty, patchy financing and reimbursement, and vague governance. Due to inequalities in health and digital literacy, patients that most stand to benefit are also often those that are least able to access and make use of telemedicine. Telemedicine has the potential to improve effectiveness, efficiency and equity in health care, but can also introduce new risks and amplify existing inequalities.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
173;As an extremely disaster-prone country and a global economic hub, Japan must prepare for public health emergencies of all kinds, from natural hazards to pandemic and disease outbreaks, industrial accidents as well as security threats such as terrorism. This chapter looks at how Japan sets-up and implements public health emergency policies and at how it builds the resilience of its health system, in accordance with the OECD Recommendation on the Governance of Critical Risks and other international guidelines. This chapter suggests that there is scope to strengthen oversight of preparedness measures implemented at the local level, strengthen co-operation between Ministries, and increase the number of disaster preparedness exercises and drills.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
174;This paper provides an overview of trends in physical health outcomes of young people over the last several decades. It makes the argument for the importance of physical health and well-being for the individual and society, including its role in education outcomes. The paper then examines interventions, identifying common factors of effective intervention design to improve physical health among young people. It ends with a discussion of remaining gaps in our knowledge and the implications of this body of research on education, communities and families.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
175;Paraguay has set ambitious targets to improve the health of its citizens. The country faces a double burden. The weight of non-communicable diseases is growing, fuelled by longer lives but also less healthy lifestyles. At the same time, unresolved issues remain in communicable diseases, maternal, neonatal and nutritional diseases. The health system in Paraguay suffers from fragmentation and the weaknesses of its stewardship institutions. To measure up to the challenge, the country has undertaken a series of reforms, starting with a landmark law passed in 1996. The reforms have succeeded in setting the stage for a new approach to healthcare based on primary care. However, they have not altered significantly the foundations of the health system and its fragmentation into multiple subsystems. This chapter describes the health challenges that Paraguay faces and focuses on challenges in financing healthcare and in achieving universal health coverage.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
176;niversal and holistic conceptions of health and well-being are at the forefront of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and are collectively prioritised across the Commonwealth. The paradigm shift from the more specific focus of the MDGs on child mortality, maternal health, HIV/AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis recognises the immense significance of global health threats that have risen to prominence in the interim. Non-communicable diseases now account for 38 million deaths per year, of which 28 million are in low- to medium-income countries. Mental illness is expected to account for 15 per cent of the global burden of disease by 2020, with young people disproportionately affected.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
177;The nine Commonwealth Pacific small states (Fiji, Kiribati, Nauru, Papua New Guinea, Samoa, Solomon Islands, Tonga, Tuvalu and Vanuatu) face a double disease burden. All have continuing prevalence of communicable diseases with ongoing high levels of susceptibility to potential epidemic diseases outbreaks. In addition, they all face the rapidly increasing health and socio-economic challenges posed by non-communicable diseases (NCDs), mainly cardiovascular diseases including stroke, diabetes, cancer and chronic respiratory diseases (GBD 2013).;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
178;"Ensuring healthy lives and promoting wellbeing for all people at all ages is the focus of Sustainable Development Goal 3 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Its nine targets address a broad and comprehensive range of priorities for sustainable protection of healthy lives, including the following: reducing maternal mortality; infant and under-5 mortality; communicable and non-communicable diseases; environmental causes of ill-health and death; substance use and abuse; and road traffic accidents; as well as ensuring access to sexual and reproductive health-care services; and achieving universal health coverage.";;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
179;This paper reports on trends in life expectancy in the 28 EU countries and some other high-income OECD countries, and examines potential explanations for the slowdown in improvements in recent years. The slowdown in improvements in life expectancy since 2011 has been greatest in the USA, where life expectancy has fallen in recent years, and the UK, but France, Germany, Sweden and Netherlands have also seen a sharp slowdown. Overall, the pace of mortality improvement has slowed in several EU countries and Australia and Canada since 2011. Diseases of older ages are major contributors to the slowdown. Improvements in cardiovascular (CVD) disease mortality have slowed in many countries, respiratory diseases, including influenza and pneumonia, have claimed excess lives in some winters, and deaths from dementia and Alzheimer's disease are rising. In some countries, notably the USA and the UK, mortality improvements have also slowed or even reversed among working age adults because of the rising numbers dying from drug-related accidental poisoning. The report also considers wider contributing factors. Although some risk factors, such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, high blood pressure and cholesterol levels, continue to decline in most EU countries, the prevalence of obesity and diabetes continues to rise. Adverse trends in inequalities could also have an impact if some population groups experience lower gains in longevity than others, thereby reducing the overall gain. Looking ahead, it is unclear whether the current slowdown in mortality improvements in some EU countries and the USA is a long-term trend or not, whether the slowdown in major killers such as CVD will persist, and whether or not the excess winter mortality seen in some years becomes a regular feature given population ageing and increasing numbers of frail, older people. The timely monitoring and investigation of mortality trends, including through international collaboration where possible, can facilitate early implementation of remedial strategies.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
180;"This chapter evaluates policies and programmes aimed at strengthening the employment focus of the mental health system. The analysis examines how New Zealand’s health system promotes wellbeing and supports mental health conditions when they arise, ensuring that appropriate and timely access to adequate services which recognise the benefits of meaningful work for people experiencing mental health conditions are available. It considers how the system provides training and support to health practitioners, particularly in primary care; and the tools and incentives available to address work and sickness issues. The analysis uses the 2015 OECD Recommendation of the Council on Integrated Mental Health, Skills and Work Policy as the primary benchmark for informing best practice policies in this field.";;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
181;"Sustainable Development Goal 3 of the 2030 Agenda, to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages, addresses all major health priorities, including reproductive, maternal and child health; communicable, non-communicable and environmental diseases; universal health coverage; and access for all to safe, effective, quality and affordable medicines and vaccines. It also contains calls for more research and development, increased health financing and the strengthened capacity of all countries in health risk reduction and management. Agenda 2063 also contains goals that seek to ensure healthy and well-nourished citizens. There is therefore a high degree of convergence between both Agendas.";;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
182;The health, social and economic consequences of poor mental health are substantial. More attention is focusing now on the development of actions to promote better mental health and wellbeing and prevent mental ill-health. This paper provides an overview of the development of approaches to promoting mental wellbeing and preventing mental ill-health in OECD countries, together with an assessment of what is known on their effectiveness and cost effectiveness. The paper finds that there is a sound and quite extensive evidence base for effective and cost effective actions which can promote mental wellbeing and prevent mental ill-health. However, the existence of actions and programmes in mental health promotion and prevention is uneven both between countries, and across different points of the life course. Many countries could stand to scale-up their promotion and prevention efforts in the mental health field, and further efforts are particularly needed to introduce interventions targeted at unemployed and older populations.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
183;"1 2017 HLPF Thematic Review of SDG3: Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages1 1. Status of progress Goal 3 seeks to ensure health and well-being for all, at all ages; and in all settings, including humanitarian and fragile. The Goal addresses all major health priorities, including sexual, reproductive, maternal, newborn, child and adolescent health, communicable, non-communicable and environmental diseases, universal health coverage and access for all to safe, effective, quality and affordable medicines and vaccines. It also calls for more research and development, increased and diversified health financing, enhanced health workforce and strengthened capacity of all countries in health risk reduction and management. Universal health coverage (UHC) acts as key driver for achieving all targets. Investment in all the health related targets in the 2030 agenda is a prerequisite as the health focus moves to contend with the double burden of long held priorities in communicable diseases, the unfinished MDG agenda and emerging issues such as NCDs and injuries. WHO has reviewed the status of 31 health and health–related indicators in World Health Statistics 2016 and updated the information in World Health Statistics 2017.";;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
184;The 2017 publication provides an assessment of evidence regarding inter-sectoral action and reducing inequalities. The available data show that, in spite of progress made during the MDG era, major challenges remain in terms of reducing maternal, newborn and child mortality, improving nutrition, ensuring universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights, and making further progress in the battle against communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted infections, tuberculosis, malaria, neglected tropical diseases and hepatitis. Weak health systems remain an obstacle in many countries, resulting in deficiencies in coverage and utilization for even the most basic health services and inadequate preparedness for health emergencies. Pervasive violence against women and girls reinforces gender inequities in health and access to services.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
185;Provision of quality care is uneven, often failing to protect, promote and respect the rights and dignity of those who seek it, particularly women and girls. Migrant and refugee populations, which are often exposed to multiple health risks, also largely lack access to health services. Inequities in access exist within and across countries due to structural disparities by income level, group characteristics, residence, experience of conflict or humanitarian disasters, by age and by sex. Like all the SDGs, Goal 3 is interwoven throughout the 2030 Agenda, with its targets directly linking to targets in other goals. Among these are 2.2 (end all forms of malnutrition) 4.1 (free, equitable and good-quality secondary education), 4.2 (good-quality early childhood development), 4.7 (knowledge and skills for sustainable development), 5.2 (eliminate all forms of violence against women and girls in the public and private spheres), 5.3 (eliminate all harmful practices, including female genital mutilation), 5.6 (universal access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights), 6.1 1 This background note has been developed by members of ECESA Plus as a coordinated contribution by the UN system to the 2017 HLPF in depth review of SDG 3. Co-leads: WHO and UNFPA with contributions from UNHCR, UN-Women, UNAIDS, ILO, IOM, World Bank Group, ITU, UNICEF and UN-DESA. 2 (access to drinking water), 6.2 (access to sanitation), 7.1 (access to modern energy services), 9.5 (enhance scientific research /increase number of R&D workers), 11.6 (air quality and municipal waste), 13.1 (resilience to natural disasters), and 16.1 (reduce violence and related death rates).;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
186;These interlinkages confirm that progress in health outcomes will only be achieved with progress in other related sectors, including fiscal and finance policy (e.g. taxing schemes to discourage unhealthy behaviors), nutrition, water and sanitation, air quality, road safety, education, gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, migration and peace and security. In addition, health employment plays a critical role in eradicating poverty (SDG 1), achieving better health equity (SDG3) and promoting decent work and economic growth (SDG 8). The Global Strategy on Human Resources for Health and the High-Level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth established by the UN Secretary General in 2016 recognizes that health workers are the backbone of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), strong and resilient health systems and a significant driver to the realization of all the health targets throughout the 2030 agenda. Several promising initiatives illustrate how targets can also be met through a rights-based, gender responsive, equity and integrated approach with cooperative action at the national, regional, and global levels. One such is the Global Strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents’ Health which takes a life course approach that covers 11 SDGs – all the targets in Goal 3, and specific Targets across 10 others (1-7, 9, 10, 16 and 17).;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
187;"Others include UNFPA's Flagship “State of the World Population Report 2016: 10 - How our future depends on a girl at this decisive age”; the UNAIDS Strategy On the Fast-Track to end AIDS, which is organized around five SDGs that represent the most strategic areas for the AIDS response (3, 5, 10, 16 and 17) and also addresses interlinkages with other relevant SDGs (e.g. 1, 2, 4, 8 and 11); and UNICEF’s “State of the World’s Children 2016”, which focuses specifically on equity. While successful implementation of the 2030 agenda at national levels can be monitored through various mechanisms, global challenges differ by region and initiatives such as the Africa Health Strategy 2016-2030 and Maputo Plan of Action 2016-2030 can be valuable complementary frameworks to support national action. Expanding such strategic initiative to other regions is worth consideration and should be supported by the UN development system. 2. Implementation Target 3.1 Maternal mortality ratio (MMR) stood at 216 per 100 000 live births globally in 2015, meaning around 303,000 women and girls died due to complications during pregnancy or childbirth. Achieving target 3.1 will require a huge acceleration in the annual rate of reduction of at least 7.3%, which is more than triple that attained between 1990 and 2015.";;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
188;Most maternal deaths are preventable as the necessary health interventions exist and are well known. Therefore increasing pregnant women's and girl’s access to quality care before, during and after childbirth is critical, alongside ensuring quality contraceptive services are available to prevent unwanted pregnancies. A lack of skilled care is one of the main obstacles to better health for women and girls during pregnancy and delivery, which is aggravated by a global shortage of qualified health workers, particularly midwives. In all countries that have achieved reduction in maternal death, professionally trained midwives and others with midwifery skills have been a key to success. Only 76% of women in developing regions benefit from skilled care during childbirth. This means that millions of births 3 are not assisted by a midwife, a doctor or a trained nurse. The unequal status of women and girls remain an underlying cause for the inability or delay in care seeking.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
189;Lack of access to knowledge, decision making and financial powers, often due to discrimination in law and practice, as well as violence against women and girls and gender stereotypes, are social barriers that need to be addressed alongside health system interventions. Complications in pregnancy are the leading cause of death among adolescent girls in developing countries (second cause globally). Pregnant adolescents are at increased risk of obstructed labor, a life-threatening obstetric emergency. Delay in treatment can lead to obstetric fistula or uterine rupture, hemorrhage and death of the mother and/or newborn. The global rate for adolescent births is 50 per 1000 adolescents aged 15-19 years, but the figure increases in high fertility settings such as sub-Saharan Africa to approximately 100 per 1000. Adolescent girls with unwanted pregnancies are more likely than adults to seek and obtain unsafe abortions of which an estimated three million occur every year among girls aged 15-19. Target 3.2 Globally the risk for children to die before their 5th birthday was reduced by 44 per cent since 2000, reaching 43 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015. Still a large number of preventable deaths remain, with about 16,000 children under the age of five dying every day in 2015.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
190;The neonatal mortality rate declined from 31 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2000 to 19 deaths per 1,000 live births in 2015. Neonatal mortality was highest in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa, with around 29 deaths per 1,000 live births. The main causes of neonatal mortality are intrapartum complications (including birth asphyxia), prematurity, sepsis, congenital anomalies and pneumonia. Though neonatal mortality is decreasing, its proportion of the global under-five mortality is increasing, signaling a need to ramp up focus on antenatal care programs, raising rates of births assisted by qualified and skilled birth attendants, secure access to basic neonatal resuscitation facilities and sanitary delivery conditions as well as early nutritional guidance and support. Huge disparities exist across and within countries, with under-five mortality rates ranging from 2 to 157 deaths per 1,000 live births. The countries with the highest rates were concentrated in sub Saharan Africa and South Asia.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
191;The main causes of under- five mortality are pneumonia, diarrhea, injuries and NCDs. Social determinants greatly impact on child survival and death as children from the poorest households are, on average, nearly twice as likely to die before the age of five as children from the richest households as shown by survey data from some 50 countries. Similarly children to mothers who lack education are 2.8 times as likely to die as those whose mothers have at least a secondary education. These stark differences underline the importance of disaggregated child mortality data in order to better tailor and implement effective interventions and the need for multi- sectoral approaches to combat remaining child mortality. Target 3.3 Globally in 2015, the rate of new HIV infections among all people was 0.3 new infections per 1,000 people, with 2.1 million becoming newly infected.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
192;Due to the success of national HIV programmes, the HIV incidence rate among children (less than 15 years of age) declined by 59% to 0.31 new infections per 1,000 children between 2010 and 2015, yet still 150 000 children were born with HIV in 2015. The incidence of HIV was highest in sub-Saharan Africa, with 1.5 new infections per 1,000 people. Among adolescents and adults aged 15-49 years in sub-Saharan Africa the incidence rate declined by 18% between 2010 and 2015 and was 2.44 among men and 3.22 among women. Young 4 women aged 15-24 years are at a particularly high risk of HIV infection, accounting for 20 % of new infections among adults globally in 2015. In sub-Saharan Africa young women represented 25 % of new HIV infection among adults. Overall, AIDS remains the leading cause of death among women aged between 15 and 49 years. Furthermore, approximately 1800 young people are newly infected with HIV every day.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
193;This underscores the importance of ensuring that young people can fully exercise their rights to access sexual and reproductive health and HIV information, commodities and services, including knowledge of HIV prevention and power to negotiate condom use, and comprehensive sexuality education free from discrimination, coercion and violence At the same time, key populations, including sex workers, people who inject drugs, transgender people and men who have sex with men remain at much higher risk of HIV infection and require access to comprehensive prevention services, including harm reduction. Tuberculosis (TB) is a treatable and curable disease, but remains a major global health problem. In 2015, there were an estimated 10.4 million new TB cases (1 million of which were under age 15) , corresponding to 142 cases per 100 000 population. The incidence rate varied widely between countries, and declined by 1.5% since 2014.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
194;More than 67 million healthy children have latent TB infection and are at risk of developing the disease. There were 1.4 million deaths from TB and an additional 0.4 million deaths resulting from TB disease among HIV-positive people. The European region carries the highest rates of drug resistant TB (16% of new and 48% of previously treated cases) and over 20% of the global burden of multi-drug resistant TB (MDR/RR-TB). In 2015, the malaria incidence rate was 91 per 1000 persons at risk, representing a 41% decrease globally between 2000 and 2015. Rates of decline in sub-Saharan Africa – where 90% of malaria cases occur - lagged behind most other regions. Reductions in incidence rates need to be accelerated in countries with the highest numbers of cases. Malaria remains a major cause of death for children under age 5 and account for 5% of under 5 mortality globally and 10% in sub-Saharan Africa. Global deaths attributable to hepatitis are estimated to be around 1.3 million in 2015. Global coverage with three doses of Hepatitis B vaccine, a priority intervention, reached 84% among infants in 2015. In the same year 1.59 billion people were reported to require mass or individual treatment and care for neglected tropical diseases (NTDs), down from 2.0 billion in 2010.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
195;The 583 million people requiring treatment and care in least developed countries (LDCs) represented 61% of those countries’ populations, down from 78% in 2010. More than 1 billion people living outside of the group of LDCs still required treatment and care for NTDs. All regions have made progress in reducing the percentages of their populations requiring treatment and care in the period 2010-2015. Target 3.4 In 2015, a total of 40 million deaths due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs) occurred (70% of the global total of 56 million deaths). The majority were caused by the four main NCDs: 17.7 million were from cardiovascular diseases, 8.8 million from cancers, 3.9 million from chronic respiratory diseases, and 1.6 million from diabetes. The risk of dying from the four main NCDs between ages 30 and 70 decreased from 23% in 2000 to 19% in 2015. Adults in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) had the highest probability of dying from the four main NCDs (34%), while those in Australia and New Zealand had the lowest (9%).;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
196;Men had higher risks than women in all regions. Nearly 800,000 suicide deaths occurred in 2015, representing the 2nd leading cause of injury death 5 after road traffic injuries. Men are nearly twice as likely to die from suicides as women and suicide is a major cause of death for adolescents, accounting for 6% among 15-19 year olds. Suicide mortality rates are highest in the European region, at 14.1 per 100 000 and lowest in the Eastern Mediterranean region (3.8 per 100 000). Improving mental health requires a multi-sectoral approach – a whole of government and whole of society response. Worldwide 10-20% of children and adolescents experience mental disorders. Depression alone accounts for 4.3% of the global burden of disease and is among the largest single causes of disability worldwide, particularly for women. Target 3.5 Worldwide alcohol consumption in 2016 was projected to be 6.4 litres of pure alcohol per person aged 15 and older.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
197;Consumption is increasing in the Western Pacific and South East Asia regions, while remaining relatively stable in others. Available data is inadequate and much further work is needed to improve the measurement of treatment coverage for alcohol and drug use disorders. Target 3.6 Around 1.25 million people died from road traffic injuries in 2013, with up to 50 million people sustaining non-fatal injuries as a result of road traffic collisions or crashes. Road traffic injuries are the main cause of death among people aged between 15 and 29 years and disproportionately affect vulnerable road users, i.e. pedestrians, cyclists and motorcyclists. Between 2000 and 2013 the number of road traffic deaths globally increased by approximately 13%. The risk of a road traffic death varies significantly by region. The highest rates for 2013 were in Sub-Saharan Africa, while Northern America and Europe , as well as Australia and New Zealand have rates far below the global average of 17.4 per 100 000 population (9.2 per 100 000 population and 5.5 per 100 000 population, respectively).;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
198;"No region is on track to meet the target of a 50% reduction in mortality by 2020. Target 3.7 Universal access to sexual and reproductive health-care services promotes health and well-being; saves hundreds of thousands of women’s and girls’ lives every year (with tens of millions of babies born healthy); access to voluntary family planning supporting individuals and couples to make informed choices about if, when and how many children to have, with wider social and economic impact; and places the poorest, most marginalized and excluded women and girls at the forefront in exercising their human rights. . Globally, there has been only a slight increase in the proportion of women of reproductive age who were married or in-union who had access to modern family planning methods, from 74.5% in 2000 to 76.7% in 2017. Progress has been substantial in the least developed countries, where the demand satisfied with such methods increased from 39.3% in 2000 to 57.1% in 2017.";;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
199;However, much remains to be done, as millions of women who want to delay or avoid pregnancy still do not have access to or are not using effective methods of family planning with large gaps remaining across countries and regions. Globally, childbearing in adolescence declined by 21% between 2000 and 2017 and did so by more than 50 per cent in Southern Asia. However, births in sub-Saharan Africa to girls under age 15 are projected to nearly double over the next decade if 6 immediate action is not taken. Overall, the adolescent birth rate remains high, with more than 20 births per 1,000 adolescent girls, in two thirds of the countries of the world. In 2017, an estimated 13 million births will be to girls under age 20.With almost 1.8 billion adolescents and youth globally, investing in their health and well-being is essential to achieve the 2030 agenda.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
200;Data collection and monitoring of indicators for the target should include progress made on laws and policies for universal access to sexual and reproductive health care services, integration of reproductive health into national strategies and comprehensive sexuality education. Target 3.8 The Statistical Commission recently agreed on two UHC indicators for target 3.8, which will provide the first comparable set of monitoring figures for an index of essential health service coverage and the proportion of the population with large household expenditures on health as a share of total household expenditure or income as a measure of financial protection from hardship due to catastrophic health care expenditures. . Recent data availability for tracer indicators within 3.8.1 is over 70%, and 60% of countries have at least one data point for 3.8.2.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
201;The number of tracer indicators could present a potential risk that the index may obscure lack of progress for specific child and sexual and reproductive health interventions due to the averaging effect, hence the need for tracking specific individual tracers while monitoring the index. Through the lens of leaving no-one behind, UHC includes migrants and refugees, many of whom may not have legal status or are unaccounted, in financial risk protection schemes and access to equitable health services. Target 3.9 Globally in 2012, household (indoor) air pollution from cooking with unclean fuels or inefficient technologies led to 4.3 million deaths. Ambient (outdoor) air pollution from traffic, industrial sources, waste burning or residential fuel combustion caused 3.0 million deaths during the same year. Air pollution is the largest environmental health risk for NCDs in particular, causing cardiovascular diseases, stroke, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and lung cancer.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
202;Among children under 5 years of age, household air pollution is estimated to cause half of all pneumonia deaths. Children are particularly susceptible to air pollution as they breathe in more air per unit of body weight than adults and studies suggest that ultrafine pollutant particles may also cause permanent damage to the neurological development of children. Leading to an estimated 889,000 deaths in 2012, unsafe water, unsafe sanitation and lack of hygiene remain a major risk factor for mortality, disproportionally affecting low-income communities and children under 5 years of age. The death rates from unsafe WASH services are highest in sub- Saharan Africa, Central Asia and Southern Asia, despite important progress made during the last two decades. Deaths from unintentional poisonings are a reflection of the management of hazardous chemicals throughout the world.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
203;Globally, the mortality rate from unintentional poisonings decreased by 33% between the years 2000 and 2015, but still causes 108 000 deaths annually. Many options for improving the sound management of chemicals are available for reducing poisonings, including choosing a safer chemical where available, engineering controls such as ventilation, safe storage and labelling, adequate information about products’ hazards, as well as use of personal protection when other options are not feasible. 7 Target 3.a In 2015, over 1.1 billion people smoked tobacco, far more males than females. 6 million deaths are caused annually by tobacco use. The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control has been ratified by 180 Parties representing 90% of the global population. More than 80% of Parties have either adopted new or strengthened their existing tobacco control laws and regulations.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
204;Target 3.b Global coverage of three doses of diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus immunization, as a proxy of full immunization among children, was 86% in 2015. Data from 2007-2014 show that, for selected essential medicines, median availability was only 60% and 56% in the public sector of low-income and lower-middle-income countries respectively. Access to medicines for chronic conditions and NCDs is even worse than that for acute conditions. Despite improvements in recent decades, innovation for new products remains focused away from the health needs of those living in developing countries. The current landscape of health research and development (R&D) is insufficiently aligned with global health demands and needs. As little as 1% of all funding for health R&D is allocated to diseases that are predominantly incident in developing countries. Target 3.c;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
205;Health workers are distributed unevenly across the globe. Regions with the highest burden of disease have the lowest proportion of health workforce to deliver much needed health services. Available data from 2005-2015 show that around 40% of countries have less than 1 physician per 1000 population and almost half of all countries have less than 3 nursing and midwifery personnel per 1000 population. Even in countries with higher national human resources for health densities, the workforce is inequitably distributed, rural and hard to reach areas tend to be understaffed as compared to capital cities and other regions. The joint ITU/WHO initiative “Be Healthy Be Mobile” utilizes mobile technology to help countries combat the growing burden of non-communicable diseases and their risk factors (tobacco use, an unhealthy diet, physical inactivity and the harmful use of alcohol).;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
206;The initiative brings mobile health services to scale within national health systems, by providing technical expertise on implementing mobile health interventions. It also promotes a highly multi-sectoral approach to ensure that the programmes are sustainable and has established partnerships with 8 target countries. Target 3.d Until 2016, the International Health Regulations (IHR) monitoring process involved assessing, through a self-assessment questionnaire sent to States Parties, the implementation status of 13 core capacities. 127 (65% of all State Parties) responded to the monitoring questionnaire in 2015. The average core capacity scores of all countries in 2015 was 78%. Despite the evidence of links between spread of diseases and population mobility, migration and cross border movement remain marginally addressed in early warning and risk reduction/management systems.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
207;The 2016 IHR review process acknowledged the need to include migration and mobile populations in epidemic and pandemic preparedness and response plans. Pandemic preparedness and global health security requires across the board upscaling of IHR implementation. 8 3. Recommendations Principles, enablers and multi-sectoral action The application of a human rights based approach to health is a key requirement for improving the well- being and dignity of all. There is a specific need to invest in multi-stakeholder partnerships in order to remove barriers to equitable health services which are responsive to increasingly diverse population health profiles and needs, and to reach those most further behind first. Sustained emphasis is necessary to improve multi-sectoral action, strengthen health systems, realize equity and fulfil, protect and promote human rights, promote gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, and to secure adequate and sustained financing and investment in scientific research and innovation. Without addressing violence against women and girls it will be impossible to achieve health targets, such as the elimination of HIV/AIDS, universal access to sexual and reproductive health and rights, or significant reductions in maternal mortality and morbidity.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
208;The importance of prioritizing adolescent health, including their sexual and reproductive health, is critical. A multi-sectoral approach to child health in general should go beyond the public health sector, recognizing and integrating the contributions of all sectors to child health while preserving “vertical” programs. There is therefore a need to take a life course approach to child health from preconception to adolescents and to also include the health of women prior to pregnancy. In other areas such as WASH services, there remains an urgent need to (a) improve coverage of drinking-water supply and safe quality (b) adequate sanitation in households and other settings, (e.g. schools and health facilities) and safe management of fecal waste to reduce human excreta in the environment. These services need to be accompanied by adequate hygiene practices such as handwashing after defecation or before food preparation and intake, and specifically take into account the needs of women and girls. Human resources for health The creation of fiscal space for expanding health sector employment and health protection is key, as underfunding has detrimental impacts on population`s health status and contributes to increased inequities in access to health care, and other direct and indirect costs of ill health.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
209;Managing the migration of health care workers and implementation of the international code of conduct of recruitment of health personnel needs further promotion, as well as local integration of migrant, refugee and displaced health personnel. Information and Communication Technologies have the potential to deliver incredible advances across the whole of the global healthcare ecosystem. Further investments are needed to increase coverage and accessibility, as connectivity provided by data and telecommunication networks enable health workers to be connected to information and diagnostic services and allow them to form support networks and communicate with doctors and nurses within clinics and hospitals. The benefits are wide ranging - mobile phones allow community health workers to learn and prepare for disease outbreaks, identify patient symptoms, follow established treatment protocols, perform remote diagnostics, access expert support, refer patients to clinics, send patient reminders, record delivery of health services, and receive mobile payments for those services.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
210;Social media helps to provide advice and support, and allows health workers and patients alike to benefit from shared 9 best practice, and to obtain important information about disease outbreaks and the availability of health services. Equitable access There is an urgent need to develop and implement inclusive and resilient health protection schemes, as part of broader social protection policies such as national social protection floors (SDG 1), in order to provide equitable access to quality health services for all. The right to health extends to all societies, including migrants and displaced communities. Being healthy is a fundamental precondition for migrants to work, be productive and contribute to the social and economic development of communities of origin and destination Enhancing data Similarly, monitoring and evaluation has to be scaled up and data availability and quality improved.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
211;Increased efforts are needed to support national statistical capacity to follow, track and utilize health indicator data to inform policies and programs. For SDG 3, the MDG legacy contributes to a relatively strong foundation of data and reporting frameworks. SDG 3 also benefits from targets and indicators that are largely quite clear and tangible. There are still significant gaps in some of the disaggregated data needed to monitor SDG3, and while the data needed for measuring individual targets is often clear, there are ongoing debates over the best way to assess the success in achieving the goal itself—whether to use “life expectancy” or “healthy life expectancy” as the defining measurement, for instance. The challenges of accurate data, disaggregated by age, sex, income, disability, geographic location, education and other social characteristics are not only evident in terms of SDG3, but particularly relevant to linkages with SDGs 1, 4, 5, 10, 16 and 17 from the perspective of addressing the highest needs of vulnerable populations and leaving no-one behind. Efforts to improve complete and accurate civil registration and vital statistics systems need to be stepped up significantly.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
212;The lack of data for maternal mortality of girls under 15 years of age amplifies the challenge, with an estimated 2 million giving birth every year. Adolescents and young people are significant drivers of robust economic growth and poverty reduction. Partnership The Global strategy for Women’s, Children’s and Adolescents Health, under the Every Woman Every Child (EWEC) Platform and the joint UN health organizations group (H6), as well as the Partnership for Maternal, Newborn, Child and Adolescent Health and the Special Program for Human Reproduction (HRP), plays an important role in the harmonization, alignment of partnerships and technical support to countries in materializing the universal access to sexual and reproductive health services, as well as upholding mechanisms for holding countries and donors accountable.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
213;In monitoring implementation of the 2030 agenda several UN entities with health related mandates can provide valuable contributions through a more systematic overview by their governing bodies. Some specific initiatives which are being considered are (a) the Global Strategy and Plan of Action on Public Health, Innovation and Intellectual Property, as well as (b) the Special Program for Research and Training in Tropical Diseases (TDR) which has proposed models for pooled financing that would support research and development to control neglected diseases. 10 Growing challenges Emerging threats such as Anti-Microbial Resistance, which is not fully captured in the 2030 agenda, threatens not only gains made in addressing infectious diseases, but is a silent crises which will impact adversely on SDGs beyond health, specifically those related to the environment, food and agriculture, water, sanitation, research and development, and economic growth.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
214;If not addressed it is estimated that AMR could result in a cumulative global cost of $100 trillion by 2050. Current estimates are that mental health conditions will affect one in four people throughout their lifetime. There is a strong link between mental health and poverty, as well as between mental health conditions and the economic hardship resulting from the inadequate realization of economic, social and cultural rights, as well as the rights to education, work, housing, food and water. These and other rights are also underlying determinants of mental health and the failure to adopt policy approaches which take account of these and other determinants is a major barrier to the realization of the right to mental health. Despite the impact of mental health conditions on individuals, families and communities, there is insufficient investment of both financial and human resources in the area of mental health.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
215;Global annual spending on mental health is less than $2 per person and less than $0.25 per person in low-income countries. In the context of health, the concept of parity of esteem refers to valuing mental health equally with physical health. The strong relationship between physical and mental health calls for an approach which accords equal value to both. Measures to address mental health in accordance with human rights norms and standards are crucial for the achievement of SDG 3 and the 2030 agenda as a whole.;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

245;In 72 countries with recent data, approximately 7 in 10 children aged 3 and 4 were developmentally on track in at least three of the following domains: literacy-numeracy, physical development, social-emotional development and learning.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
246;In 2015, an estimated 617 million children and adolescents of primary and lower secondary school age worldwide – more than 50 per cent – were not achieving minimum proficiency levels in reading and mathematics. Of these, about two thirds were attending school but were not learning in the classroom, or dropped out school.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
247;Some 750 million adults – two thirds of them women – remained illiterate in 2016. Half of the global illiterate population lives in South Asia, and a quarter live in sub-Saharan Africa.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
248;Many developing countries still lack basic infrastructure and facilities to provide effective learning environments. Sub-Saharan Africa faces the biggest challenges: at the primary and lower secondary levels, less than half of schools have access to electricity, the Internet, computers and basic drinking water.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
249;Globally, there has been little progress in the percentage of primary school teachers who are trained: it has been stagnating at about 85 per cent since 2015. The proportion is lowest in sub-Saharan Africa (64 per cent).;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
250;At the global level, the participation rate in early childhood and primary education was 70 per cent in 2016, up from 63 per cent in 2010. The lowest rates are found in sub-Saharan Africa (41 per cent) and Northern Africa and Western Asia (52 per cent).;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
251;An estimated 617 million children and adolescents of primary and lower secondary school age worldwide—58 per cent of that age group—are not achieving minimum proficiency in reading and mathematics.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
252;In 2016, only 34 per cent of primary schools in LDCs had electricity and less than 40 per cent were equipped with basic handwashing facilities.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
253;Despite considerable gains in education enrolment over the past 15 years, worldwide, the adjusted net enrolment rates were 91 per cent for primary education, 84 per cent for lower secondary education and 63 per cent for upper secondary education in 2014. About 263 million children and youth were out of school, including 61 million children of primary school age. Sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia account for over 70 per cent of the global out-ofschool population in primary and secondary education.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
254;Even though more children than ever are going to school, many do not acquire basic skills in reading and mathematics. Recent learning assessment studies show that in 9 of 24 sub-Saharan African countries and 6 of 15 Latin American countries with data, fewer than half of the students at the end of primary education had attained minimum proficiency levels in mathematics. In 6 of 24 sub-Saharan African countries with data, fewer than half of the students who finished their primary schooling had attained minimum proficiency levels in reading.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
255;Equity issues constitute a major challenge in education according to a recent assessment. In all countries with data, children from the richest 20 per cent of households achieved greater proficiency in reading at the end of their primary and lower secondary education than children from the poorest 20 per cent of households. In most countries with data, urban children scored higher in reading than rural children.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
256;"Pedagogy, most commonly understood as the approach to teaching, refers to the theory and practice of learning, and how this process influences, and is influenced by, the social, political and psychological development of learners. Pedagogy, taken as an academic discipline, is the study of how knowledge and skills are imparted in an educational context, and it considers the interactions that take place during learning. Both the theory and practice of pedagogy vary greatly, as they reflect different social, political, and cultural contexts.Pedagogy is often described as the act of teaching. The pedagogy adopted by teachers shapes their actions, judgments, and other teaching strategies by taking into consideration theories of learning, understandings of students and their needs, and the backgrounds and interests of individual students. Its aims may range from furthering liberal education (the general development of human potential) to the narrower specifics of vocational education (the imparting and acquisition of specific skills). Conventional western pedagogies view the teacher as knowledge holder and student as the recipient of knowledge (described by Paulo Freire as ""banking methods""), but theories of pedagogy increasingly identify the student as an agent and the teacher as a facilitator.\nInstructive strategies are governed by the pupil\'s background knowledge and experience, situation, and environment, as well as learning goals set by the student and teacher. One example would be the Socratic method.";;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
257;Education is the process of facilitating learning, or the acquisition of knowledge, skills, values, beliefs, and habits. Educational methods include teaching, training, storytelling, discussion and directed research. Education frequently takes place under the guidance of educators, however learners can also educate themselves. Education can take place in formal or informal settings and any experience that has a formative effect on the way one thinks, feels, or acts may be considered educational. The methodology of teaching is called pedagogy.\nFormal education is commonly divided formally into such stages as preschool or kindergarten, primary school, secondary school and then college, university, or apprenticeship.\nA right to education has been recognized by some governments and the United Nations. In most regions, education is compulsory up to a certain age. There is a movement for education reform, and in particular for evidence-based education.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
258;"Didacticism is a philosophy that emphasizes instructional and informative qualities in literature, art and design. In art, design, architecture and landscape, didacticism is an emerging conceptual approach that is driven by the urgent need to explain.When applied to ecological questions, didacticism in art, design, architecture and landscape attempts to persuade the viewer of environmental priorities; thus, constituting an entirely new form of explanatory discourse that presents, what can be called “eco-lessons"". This concept can be defined as ""ecological didacticism";;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;

260;Training is teaching, or developing in oneself or others, any skills and knowledge  or fitness that relate to specific useful competencies. Training has specific goals of improving one's capability, capacity, productivity and performance. It forms the core of apprenticeships and provides the backbone of content at institutes of technology (also known as technical colleges or polytechnics). In addition to the basic training required for a trade, occupation or profession, training may continue beyond initial competence to maintain, upgrade and update skills throughout working life. People within some professions and occupations may refer to this sort of training as professional development. Training also refers to the development of physical fitness related to a specific competence, such as sport, martial arts, military applications and some other occupations.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
261;Georgia has seen tremendous recent improvement in educational participation and outcomes. Nevertheless, educational progress has not been equitable across all population groups and many students in Georgia still struggle to master basic competencies. These issues reflect systemic challenges in modernising the teaching profession, using evidence in policy-making and strengthening school oversight. The country’s evaluation and assessments systems need to be strengthened in order for education outcomes to be improved for all students.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
262;ALL youth have a right to education. While education must not be reduced to considerations of youth livelihoods and transitions to the world of work, it is widely accepted that this is a major aspect of youth education. Globally, efforts towards universal education in recent decades saw the years of primary school enrolment increase and lead to the demand for secondary schooling. However, secondary and tertiary enrolment remains low in many developing countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa and Southern Asia. Inadequate infrastructure, lack of opportunities, and affordability and accessibility concerns characterize many educational systems in those regions. Elsewhere, many education and training systems are not adequately preparing students to meet the demands of a globalized world. Insufficient and/or poor-quality education, training and employment exacerbate the social and economic vulnerability of youth.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
263;SDG 4 and its associated targets set an ambitious agenda that encompasses quality learning and equity in education alongside the more traditional indicators of access and participation, at all levels of education. In doing so, it challenges every country in the world to improve its education system and marks a significant departure from previous global education goals and targets, such as the Millennium Development Goals, which were not as far-reaching and focused more on access and participation at primary level. The analysis below takes into account this lifelong learning approach and reports on youth pathways throughout their journey from education to the labour market.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
264;"This chapter reviews the issues of participation and funding of non-mandatory education, i.e. early childhood education and care (ECEC), tertiary education and lifelong learning. Participation in ECEC and tertiary education is high in Japan, but there is room for improvement in adult learning supply and demand. Non-mandatory education is mostly provided by the private sector in Japan, which imposes a significant financial burden on households. Financial support for students is of limited scope, which potentially reduces the efficiency of resource allocation and raises equity concerns. Our main findings suggest that Japan should: 1) strengthen lifelong learning and financial arrangements for non-mandatory education to support equity; and 2) design lifelong learning to meet the skills needs of both employers and the population.";;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
265;Education enables upward socioeconomic mobility and is a key to escaping poverty. Nevertheless, millions of children are still out of school, and not all who do attend are learning. More than half of all children and adolescents worldwide are not meeting minimum proficiency standards in reading and mathematics. Disparities in educational opportunities and outcomes are found across regions, and sub-Saharan Africa and parts of Central and Southern Asia lag behind. As a result, many students are not fully prepared to participate in a highly complex global economy. That gap should provide the incentive for policymakers to refocus their efforts to ensure that the quality of education is improved, and that more people of all ages can access it.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
266;"A strong lifelong learning culture, in particular in adulthood, is essential for Latvia to boost the skills of its adults, and can generate a range of personal, economic and social benefits. This chapter assesses adult leaning in Latvia and presents four opportunities to strengthen adult learning: 1) raising awareness about adult learning; 2) reducing barriers to adult learning; 3) expanding the provision of adult learning; and 4) raising the quality of adult learning.";;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
267;"Effective governance arrangements are the building blocks for improving Latvia’s performance in developing and using people’s skills. This chapter assesses skills governance in Latvia and presents four opportunities to strengthen the governance of the skills system: 1) strengthening strategies and oversight for skills policies; 2) improving co-operation at different levels of government and with stakeholders; 3) building an integrated monitoring and information system on skills; and 4) raising, targeting and sharing investments in lifelong learning.";;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
268;"This chapter reviews Latvia’s upper secondary education system and also parts of its adult education system. Currently there is a stark divide between the general and vocational upper secondary education pathways and spending is low and responsibility for provision quite fragmented. Lifelong learning is underdeveloped in Latvia, with low participation and a lack of employer support for training. In 2009 a comprehensive reform of vocational education was started aimed at raising its quality and relevance to the labour market, make it more attractive to students and enhance resource efficiency. The Latvian government should continue improving the relevance and quality of vocational education, strengthening the capacity of stakeholders to contribute to the process and closely monitoring its progress; narrow the divide between general and vocational tracks both through organisational changes and curriculum reform; and increase take up of lifelong learning.";;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
269;Australians have among the best literacy skills compared with other countries participating in the Survey of Adult Skills (PIAAC). At the same time, their performance in numeracy is only average and there is evidence suggesting that numeracy skills have been declining in recent years. Mathematics performances among students in secondary education could usefully be improved. But this chapter also points to a significant gender difference in numeracy performance, with women scoring lower than men and being underrepresented in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) occupations. Policies to attract and retain more women in the STEM workforce would help to reduce occupational segmentation in the labour force and improve gender equity in labour market outcomes.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
270;Lifelong learning is a crucial ingredient of skills policies, in that it might facilitate re-skilling (in response to changing skills demands) and prevent age-related skills decline (in response to longer working careers). Migrants might have more incentives and a higher need to participate in adult training, but might also face higher financial or non-financial barriers to participation. This Chapter shows that migrants participate less in lifelong learning than natives, but the differences are not very large, and are mostly accounted for by differences in observable individual characteristics. On the other hand, migrants are more likely to report not having been able to participate in training activities they were interested in, largely because of financial barriers and family responsibilities. Migrants therefore appear to express a high demand for existing training opportunities, and indeed the data show that, once they are able to gain access to training opportunities, migrants tend to spend more time than natives in such activities.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
271;The OECD last reviewed the education policies of the Republic of North Macedonia in 2003 (OECD, 2003[1]). Today, sixteen years on, more children and young people participate in education and remain in school for longer. There have also been major institutional improvements since 2003, with the creation of separate government agencies that now concentrate professional capacity for key evaluation and assessment functions. This includes the National Examinations Centre (NEC), which manages the country’s state matura examination that is recognised across the region for its innovative design and integrity. It also includes the State Education Inspectorate (SEI), which leads and supports regular external and internal school evaluations in North Macedonia. School evaluations focus on many of the aspects of the school environment that research recognises to be essential for learning.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
272;"The chapter presents diagnostic evidence on adult learning in Flanders, the factors that affect adult learning and specific policies and practices to foster a learning culture. Flanders can develop a learning culture by taking action in seven areas. These are: 1) raising awareness about the importance of adult learning; 2) tailoring adult education provision to the specific needs of adult learners; 3) transforming adult education providers into learning organisations; 4) making higher education more accessible for adult learners; 5) promoting work-based learning in post-secondary education; 6) promoting human resource practices that stimulate a learning culture in the workplace.";;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
273;"Fostering greater participation in adult learning of all forms can help adults to upskill and address deficiencies in their skill sets, or reskill to respond to changing labour market needs. Adult learning can improve adults’ employment and social outcomes, as well as enterprises’ productivity and performance. This chapter explores three opportunities to foster greater participation in adult learning in Poland: 1) raising awareness of adult learning benefits and opportunities; 2) making learning more flexible and accessible for adults; and 3) better sharing and targeting financing to increase participation in adult learning.";;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
274;This chapter takes an in-depth look at the transition from school to work in Finland. It first examines early school leaving and identifies ways to raise completion rates in (vocational) upper secondary education and improve outreach to early school leavers. The chapter then discusses how to ease the transition from upper secondary to tertiary education, by reforming the highly selective tertiary education admission system, improving the student financial aid system and widening the options for vocational students in postsecondary education. Finally, the chapter investigates ways to speed up labour market entry, through tighter collaboration between education providers and the labour market and more attention to mental health in tertiary education.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
275;This chapter analyses stages of young Koreans’ educational and labour market trajectories that can contribute to skill mismatches. It first provides an overview of Korean students’ choices concerning general and vocational education and discusses career guidance policies. In the following two parts, the chapter focuses on initiatives to strengthen the quality and labour market relevance of upper secondary vocational and tertiary education, respectively. Finally, it presents current practices and advantages of competency-based hiring.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
276;Digitalisation and new technologies are developing rapidly, affecting businesses and the labour market. The digital era presents a huge opportunity while at the same time also brings significant risks. Business in the digital era will demand labour with a new set of skills. Education systems will therefore need to adapt to meet this new demand. Emerging Asian countries need to adopt an allencompassing approach to support teaching at all levels, including providing sufficient ICT infrastructure to schools, improving ICT skills of teachers, adapting curricula to include ICT and addressing the gender digital divide. Enhancing the role of TVET and lifelong learning is another priority area in providing education for the digital era.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
277;"The first five years of a child’s life is a period of great opportunity, and risk. The cognitive and social-emotional skills that children develop in these early years have long-lasting impacts on their later outcomes throughout schooling and adulthood.
This report sets out the findings from the International Early Learning and Child Well-being Study in England. The study assesses children’s skills across both cognitive and social-emotional development, and how these relate to children’s early learning experiences at home and in early childhood education and care. It is enriched by contextual and assessment information from the children’s parents and educators. It provides comparative data on children’s early skills with children from Estonia and the United States, who also participated in the study, to better identify factors that promote or hinder children’s early learning.";;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
278;This chapter provides an overview of the Slovak Republic’s adult learning system and specific recommendations to foster greater participation. Slovakia’s economy has shown strong performance, which is reflected in low unemployment rates and rising wages. However, Slovakia faces high risks of job automation, and its degree of economic openness makes it vulnerable to external trade shocks and fluctuations in foreign demand for Slovak products and services. In this context, adult learning is an essential tool to shield the Slovak Republic against these risks and to lead the country to higher levels of development and well-being. This chapter identifies three opportunities to raise participation in adult learning: improving the governance of adult learning, increasing participation among adults out of work, and supporting the capacity of employees and firms to engage in adult learning.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
279;Despite improvements in recent years, many students in Romania still progress through school without mastering basic competencies and a large share of them leave school before completing upper secondary education. This education policy brief focuses on policies that can support Romania in ensuring that all students participate in and complete education – particularly those from disadvantaged groups. In particular, this brief focuses on improving functional literacy, reducing early school leaving and helping early school leavers return to education.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
280;Education and skills are central to employability. Young people who leave school before they achieve a sufficient level of proficiency in literacy and numeracy find it difficult to enter the labour market. Increasingly, employers are looking for workers who are not only proficient in these cognitive skills, but who can also apply those skills to solve problems, and who are also deft in “soft” skills, such as communicating and working well in a team. This chapter offers an overview of how education today, including compulsory schooling, vocational education and training, and tertiary education, prepares young people for the world of work.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
281;Quality education has the power to end intergenerational cycles of inequity, improving the lives of children and the societies in which they live. Education can provide children with the knowledge and skills they need to succeed in life. It is associated with increased incomes, reduced poverty and improved health. But for education to play this role, it must begin with early childhood development and continue with quality learning opportunities that provide all children, especially the most disadvantaged, with a fair chance to thrive.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
282;1 2017 HLPF Thematic review of SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls1 The gender-responsive implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development presents an enormous opportunity to achieve gender equality, end poverty and hunger, combat inequalities within and among countries, build peaceful, just and inclusive societies, protect and promote human rights, and ensure the lasting protection of the planet and its natural resources. The SDGs provide an important framework for collective action to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and the realization of their full enjoyment of all human rights. This work requires continued attention to the implementation of outcomes of major United Nations conferences and Summits, including the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, as well as sustained implementation of international human rights treaties.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
283;Status of progress As part of the broader ongoing effort to highlight progress, gaps and challenges in SDG implementation, this section provides brief analyses of trend data for SDG 5 targets and status updates since the inaugural report of the Secretary-General on Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (E/2016/75). At this early stage, data is not yet available on trends that can illustrate SDG 5 implementation. 5.1: Some progress has been made in recent years to end discrimination against women and girls in laws, policies and practices, 2 but currently there is no comprehensive overview of data on legal frameworks in place to promote, enforce and monitor equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex. Discriminatory constitutional and legislative provisions are still in place in many countries, including in family, divorce and personal laws, penal codes, nationality laws, and laws relating to inheritance and ownership and control over land and other resources;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
284;. 5.2: Violence against women and girls in private and public spaces is a persistent phenomenon that no country has managed to eliminate. Comparability of data regionally and globally remains a major challenge. Latest comparable data for 87 countries from 2005 to 2016, including 30 from developed regions, shows that 19 per cent of girls and women aged 15 to 49 years have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner in the past 12 months. Data also shows that one in three 1 1 This background note has been developed by members of ECESA Plus as a coordinated contribution by the UN system to the 2017 HLPF in depth review of SDG 5.

285;2 women experience physical and/or sexual violence by a partner or sexual violence by a non-partner in their lifetime. Women who have experienced intimate partner violence are 50 per cent more likely to acquire HIV than women who have not. 3 Data on prevalence of violence against women and girls with disabilities, women and girls from ethnic minorities, women migrant workers and women above the age of 49, who are not included in many violence against women surveys, is lacking despite such surveys having been conducted in more than 100 countries. 5.3: While the prevalence of child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation and cutting (FGM/C) has been gradually declining over the past three decades, rates are still unacceptably high. Over 750 million women and girls alive today were married before their 18th birthday, meaning that just over 1 in 4 young women were married in childhood, which indicates a decline from nearly 1 in 3 around 1990. 4 Although uneven across regions and countries, progress on marriage of girls under 15 years, which has declined from 11 per cent in 1990 to 8 per cent today – representing an average annual rate of reduction twice that of marriage by age 18. Rates of FGM/C have declined by 30 per cent overall, but progress is not universal and the pace of decline is uneven.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
286;At least 200 million girls have undergone FGM/C in the 30 countries with representative prevalence data, or more than one third of girls aged 15 to 19 today, compared with nearly one in two in the mid-1980s. 5 Collecting consistent and reliable data on FGM/C is challenging due to the sensitive nature of the issue, and despite enhanced surveying on FGM/C in relevant countries, data sets are not necessarily comparable as different methodologies are used across and within countries. 5.4: Women and girls perform the bulk of unpaid care and domestic work, including caregiving and household tasks, in every region. On average, women spend 19 per cent of their time daily on unpaid care work, compared with 8 per cent for men. This disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work, together with paid labour, means women and girls work longer hours and have less time for rest, self-care, learning, and other activities, such as political participation.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
287;5.5: Parliamentary elections were held in 53 countries in 2016, which led to an increase in the global average of women in national parliaments, from 22.6 per cent in 2015 to 23.3 per cent in December 2016. 6 This constitutes a modest 6.5 percentage point gain in ten years. Women remain underrepresented in managerial positions, especially in senior and middle management. In the past decade, the share of women in senior and middle management positions increased in only 44 per cent of the countries with available data. 7 The proportion of women in managerial positions in media have declined from 28 per cent in 2010 to 27 per cent in 2015. 8 Participation of women in scientific research 3 Global and regional estimates of violence against women: prevalence and health effects of intimate partner violence and non-partner sexual violence.

The impact of legal barriers can be evidenced in women’s ability to make their own decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use, HIV prevention and health care. Only 50 percent of women, aged 15-49 years, married or in union, make their own decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and health care, according to data available from 45 countries. 1;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
289;1 Currently there is no comprehensive overview of data on laws and regulations that guarantee women and men aged 15 and older full and equal access to sexual and reproductive health care, information and education. 5.a: Control over and ownership of assets can provide women with greater protection and enhance their bargaining power within the household and their capacity for economic independence. Gender differences in land tenure and access to productive resources are particularly relevant, as rural women are significant contributors to global food production. Gains associated with eliminating the gender gap in agriculture can potentially increase national production by 2.5 to 4 per cent, as suggested from countries where data is available, and can potentially lead to associated declines in rates of undernourishment of 12 to 17 per cent. 12 Data on women’s access to economic resources, including land, property and financial services, remains limited and not internationally comparable.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
290;5.b: The spread of new technologies, particularly mobile phones and internet, has increased opportunities to communicate, and access information and services. However, women in developing countries face unique challenges in accessing information and communication technology (ICT) to unlock educational and employment opportunities. In low and middle income countries women are 21 per cent less likely to own a mobile phone than men. In 2016, women’s internet use was 12.2 per cent lower than men’s, with a significantly higher gap in LDCs (30.9 per cent). The global gender digital divide has widened by 1.2 per cent since 2013, equivalent to a total gap of some 257 million more men online than women. This has an impact on the way in which goods and services are created, produced, distributed and accessed in the digital environment. Women are not adequately represented as stakeholders, co-creators, and beneficiaries of technology-based interventions and often lack access to technology, digital skills, and media and information literacy.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
291;5.c: There is a need to significantly increase investments for gender equality and track public allocations for gender equality.

292;Principal interlinkages of SDG 5 with other goals and how they impact policy-making The 2030 Agenda takes a holistic approach to addressing the challenges of sustainable development, and prioritizes gender equality as a standalone goal and a cross-cutting issue, without which the overarching aims of the Agenda cannot be realized. The SDG framework includes comprehensive commitments across the board that contribute to the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and in this regard policy decisions should harness these interlinkages. The following mutually reinforcing linkages between SDG 5 and other SDGs, while not intended to be exhaustive, demonstrate how implementation of targets across the framework significantly contributes to outcomes for women and girls. Ending all forms of discrimination:;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
293;Ending discrimination against women and girls (5.1, 5.c, 10.3, and 16.b) is a prerequisite to achieving many other SDGs, such as ensuring equal access to quality and affordable education at all levels (4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 5.1, 5.5), access to the labour market (8.3, 8.5), and political participation (5.5 and 10.2). Ending all forms of discrimination empowers women and girls to contribution to poverty eradication (1) and promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development (16), and promotes women’s engagement in trade activities, the formation of small enterprises and their access to full and productive employment and decent work, including equal pay for equal work or work of equal value (8.3 and 8.5). Eliminating violence and harmful practices: Eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls is central to the overall achievement of gender equality, as well as the eradication of poverty and the achievement of sustainable development, peace and security and human rights (5.2, 5.3, 16.1, 16.2). Measures in other SDG targets demonstrate the important contribution of the SDG framework to the elimination of violence against women and girls, including through promoting a culture of peace and non-violence (4.7), and providing safe public spaces (11.7) and transport (11.2). In addition, registering girls at birth (16.9) and recording their marriages provides legal backing against harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage (5.3). Promoting economic empowerment and financing:;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
294;The promotion of women’s economic empowerment is prominent across several SDG targets, particularly with a focus on poverty eradication, women’s and girls’ education, equal rights for women and men to social protection systems, economic and productive resources and gender-sensitive development strategies (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.b, 2.3, 4.1, 4.3, 4.5 and 5.a). Ensuring women's economic rights, including women’s equal opportunities to organize for better wages and working conditions, and improving their access to land and resources, including financial services and control over income, is critical to achieving full and productive employment and decent work (8.5 and 9.5) and contributes to peaceful and inclusive societies (16). Women’s access to decent work (8) is often hampered by the disproportionate share of time devoted to unpaid care and domestic work (5.4), thus linked to lack of available infrastructure and technology (9.1 and 9.4).;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
295;Supporting enterprise growth, generating employment and promoting sustainable industrial 13 “Making development co-operation more effective.” Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation. (2016)   5 development (9.2) requires financial services, including affordable credit, and women’s integration in value chains and markets (9.3). Volatile and rising food prices have a detrimental impact on women’s access to food, which underlines the importance of policies to prevent food price hikes, and the need for governments to ensure the affordability and accessibility of food (2.3). Trade liberalization (17.11, 17.12) in labour-abundant economies can support the transition from agriculture to industry and services. Implementation of gender equality targets requires adequate financing from all sources, including domestic resources, private sector financing and official development assistance (17.3). Ensuring participation and leadership in decision-making:;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
296;Women’s full and effective participation in leadership and decision-making, in political, economic and public life (5.5) is a strong enabler for other SDG targets, including those on water and sanitation resource management, reducing inequalities, and promoting peaceful and inclusive societies (6.b and 16.7). Women’s full participation in economic and political life (5.5 and 16.7) can increase productivity, create decent work (8.3 and 8.5), enhance agricultural productivity in smallholder farms (2.3), and strengthen women’s agency in making decisions about their health and rights (3.1, 3.3, 3.7 and 5.6). Women’s full and equal participation is also critical to contribute to climate-change related planning and management (13.b) and the sustainable use and management of terrestrial ecosystems (15.1 and15.2), taking into account the specific knowledge of indigenous women.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
297;Ensuring healthy lives: Access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights (5.6) and sexual and reproductive health services (3.7) are directly linked to the reduction of maternal mortality (3.1), and ending communicable diseases such as HIV and AIDS (3.3). Women’s and girls’ lack of autonomy and decision-making over their sexual and reproductive health can severely limit their economic and other outcomes, such as education (4), employment (8) and their ability to promote peaceful and inclusive societies (16). Further, women’s critical roles in the global health workforce, comprising 67 per cent across 123 countries, provide a strong link between investing in the health workforce (3.c), recognizing and valuing unpaid care and domestic work (5.4) and achieving full and productive employment and decent work (8.5). Improving sanitation and hygiene addresses the needs of women and girls, including menstrual hygiene, and contributes to realizing several goals (3, 4, 5, 8). Detailed look at implementation Since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, Member States have put in place mechanisms to support the implementation of the SDGs. In some cases, governments have established inter-ministerial committees to strengthen implementation efforts through policy coordination and coherence.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
298;Governments have taken steps to integrate the SDGs into national sustainable development strategies, and in this regard, have assessed existing national capacities for implementing and monitoring the SDGs, including financial resources and statistical capacity. In an effort to strengthen institutional effectiveness to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, some Member States have strengthened the mandates of national mechanisms for the promotion of gender equality (Australia and Philippines), and set up local level gender equality 6 mechanisms (Bosnia Herzegovina, Georgia and Nepal). 14 Member States have prioritized gender mainstreaming in SDG implementation through establishing gender equality as a cross-cutting priority in national sustainable development plans (Mexico, Paraguay and Qatar), and making gender mainstreaming a central strategy for development policies (Kenya). In the context of strengthening national statistical capacities to monitor the implementation of SDG 5 some Member States have enhanced inter-agency mechanisms on gender statistics (Colombia, Cuba and the Philippines), or strengthened gender statistics focal points in their national statistics offices (Jamaica and Norway).;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
299;In this regard, Member States have also made progress in developing and enhancing methodologies for measuring different forms of gender-based discrimination, including on violence against women (Albania, Argentina, Mexico, the Philippines, Paraguay, Peru, Spain and Sri Lanka) and on unpaid care work (Kenya, Mexico, Peru and the Philippines) through, in particular, time use surveys. 15 Challenges identified for implementation at the national level Despite extensive efforts made by governments to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls through enacting legal frameworks, women and girls continue to be subjected to discrimination, violence and harmful practices and denied the full realization of their human rights. Throughout the world, women face barriers in realizing their economic rights, due to entrenched gender stereotypes and negative social norms that limit women’s equal access to land, property and financial services, and which in turn shape outcomes for women related to labour markets, entrepreneurship and innovation.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
300;The promotion of gender stereotypes through the media remains a challenge to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. The lack of adequate infrastructure and access to information and communications technologies for women and girls limits their educational opportunities and access to labour markets. Women’s ability to decide freely on their sexual and reproductive health, in some cases, is undermined by third-party consent requirements and restrictions on essential information and health services and contraceptive services. Inadequate resources for the implementation of national action plans on gender equality and other gender equality policies is a significant challenge across all countries. While governments are increasingly adopting gender-responsive budgeting and monitoring public expenditures on gender equality, the impact of such efforts is reduced when overall budgets for gender equality policies and the provision of services, social protection and infrastructure are inadequate. Chronic under-investment in rural infrastructure and technology has a disproportionately negative impact for women living in rural areas, as women often engage in time consuming unpaid care work, including fetching water and fuel, which prevents them from engaging in paid work.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
301;One of the key challenges that hampers the implementation and monitoring of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls at the national level is the lack of adequate gender-sensitive data, including data disaggregated by sex, age and other relevant characteristics in national contexts. Of the 230 unique global SDG indicators, currently 53 (23 per cent) make explicit reference to women, girls, 14 Report of the Secretary-General on the Review of the implementation of the agreed conclusions from the fifty-eight session of the Commission on the Status of Women (E/CN.6/2017/4) 15 Ibid. 7 gender or sex, including the 14 indicators under SDG 5. In addition, many gender-related indicators in other SDGs currently lack methodologies for data collection to support comprehensive and periodic monitoring. Such lack of data on key areas of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls weakens the ability of Member States and other stakeholders to develop evidence-based policies.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
302;The absence of statistics in these areas may be attributed to a lack of prioritizing gender equality in data collection and from a lack of resources. Targeted actions by governments, development agencies, civil society organizations and communities, including through improved funding, can enhance the collection, analysis and use of gender statistics, including sex-disaggregated data, in areas such as poverty, education, health, employment, social protection, income distribution within households, unpaid care and domestic work, violence against women and girls, and women’s access to, control over, and ownership of assets and resources, including water. Opportunities identified for implementation There are important opportunities at the local, national, regional and global levels that governments and other stakeholders can leverage to promote the gender-responsive implementation of the 2030 Agenda.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
303;At the local level, a focus on improved local government service delivery and spending on the greatest gaps can help overcome gender-inequality. At national level, eliminating gender-based inequalities in legal frameworks and policies should be a key priority, together with strengthening of national gender equality mechanisms to ensure their leadership and effective contribution to the implementation of the SDGs, including by placing such mechanisms at the highest possible level of government with increased authority, capacity and funding. At regional and global levels, governments can utilize existing mechanisms to demonstrate progress toward the implementation of gender equality commitments, including reporting under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) by States parties.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
304;The quinquennial reviews of the Beijing Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development are also opportunities to assess progress in implementation of SDG 5, identify regional trends and opportunities for peer learning as well as identify gaps and challenges in implementation. Stakeholder engagement The implementation of the SDGs provides an opportunity for decision-makers to embed the multi- stakeholder principles of the 2030 Agenda into their policy agendas and promote coordinated efforts with civil society, the private sector, the United Nations system and other actors. Close monitoring through participatory processes will be essential for ensuring the effective implementation of the SDGs. Active civil society participation and involvement in decision-making at the national level, including by women’s organizations, women’s human rights defenders and youth-led organizations should be an integral part of such efforts.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
305;During the elaboration of the 2030 Agenda, women’s organizations were particularly effective in building coalitions and alliances across different interest groups, and implementation should build on their involvement. Engaging the private sector to implement relevant components will also be crucial, including through the provision of technical and financial support for programming. National human rights institutions, can provide an important contribution by ensuring implementation of national development plans adhere to human rights principles. 8 UN system To address data gaps in monitoring the implementation of SDG 5 and other gender-related targets, the United Nations system is stepping up its efforts to help countries close gender data gaps through direct technical and financial support and has strengthened its internal coordination mechanisms to effectively support Member States.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
306;United Nations entities are also leading the collection of data for various SDG indicators as well as the development of methodologies and standards for indicators for which methodologies and standards do not yet exist. At its session in March 2017, the UN Statistical Commission reviewed and endorsed the methodology to measure asset ownership from a gender perspective developed through the Evidence and Data for Gender Equality (EDGE) programme, paving the way for more consistent data collection in the future. In areas where acute data gaps have been identified such as sex, disability and age disaggregated data, various initiatives are underway to improve data production and use. Additionally, the creation of an Inter-Agency Group on Violence against Women Data and its Technical Advisory Group will facilitate the compilation of harmonized country level data on violence against women, which will support global reporting on violence against women and girls, including in the context of SDG implementation. Similarly, the UN Joint Programme on Essential Services for Victims and Survivors of Violence, the Gender-Sensitive Indicators for Media and the World Water Assessment Programme, have worked to strengthen gender data collection.;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
307;"The United Nations system has also developed joint programmes and other collaborative efforts to support coordinated approaches to gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, including through the Inter-Agency Network on Women and Gender Equality (IANWGE). Joint programmes to support governments and other stakeholders include: the UNFPA/UNICEF Joint Programme on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting; the UNFPA/UNICEF Global Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage; the Joint Programme on Empowering Adolescent Girls and Young Women through Education; the High-level Working Group on Health and Human Rights; the High-level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth and the ILO/OECD/WHO Working for Health Programme; the Inter-Agency Working Group on Gender Equality and HIV;";;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;
308;"the UN System Network on Rural Development and Food Security; the Inter-agency Task Force on Violence Against Women; the United Nations Joint Global Programme on Essential Services for Women and Girls Subject to Violence; the Global Alliance on Media and Gender; the Island Women Open Network for Sustainable Energy and Climate Resilience in Island Nations; and the Joint Global Programme on Inclusive and Equitable Local Development. Recommendations Areas where gaps exist As governments and other stakeholders continue to implement SDG 5, concerted efforts will be needed to address existing gaps in implementation, particularly regarding structural barriers to gender equality, strengthening accountability mechanisms at the national level, increasing investment and financing for gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, and increasing data collection capacity.";;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;;

338;Recent data from 106 countries show that 18 per cent of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15 to 49 have experienced physical and/or sexual partner violence in the previous 12 months. The prevalence is highest in least developed countries, at 24 per cent.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
339;The practice of child marriage has continued to decline around the world, largely driven by progress in South Asia, where a girl’s risk of marrying in childhood decreased by about one quarter between 2013 and 2018. In sub-Saharan Africa, levels of child marriage have declined at a more modest rate.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
340;At least 200 million girls and women have been subjected to female genital mutilation, based on data from 30 countries where the practice is concentrated and where nationally representative prevalence data is available. In these countries, the prevalence of this harmful practice declined by one quarter between approximately 2000 and 2018.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
341;According to recent data from some 90 countries, women devote on average roughly three times more hours a day to unpaid care and domestic work than men, limiting the time available for paid work, education and leisure and further reinforcing gender-based socioeconomic disadvantages.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
342;Women continue to be underrepresented at all levels of political leadership. As at 1 January 2019, women’s representation in national Parliaments ranged from 0 to 61.3 per cent, with the average standing at 24.2 per cent, an increase from 19 per cent in 2010. At the local level, data from 99 countries and areas show that women’s representation in elected deliberative bodies varies from less than 1 per cent to 48 per cent, with the median of the distribution at 26 per cent. When legislated gender quotas are adopted, significantly higher proportions of women are elected at both national and local levels.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
343;While women represented 39 per cent of world employment, only 27 per cent of managerial positions in the world were occupied by women in 2018, up only marginally from 26 per cent in 2015. The proportion of women in management has increased since 2000 in all regions except in least developed countries.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
344;In 51 countries with data on the subject, only 57 per cent of women aged 15 to 49, married or in union, make their own decisions about sexual relations and the use of contraceptives and health services.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
345;"Over the past 25 years, there has been progress in reforming laws towards improving gender equality, yet discriminatory laws and gaps in legal protection remain in many countries. On the basis of data collected across four areas of law in 2018 from 53 countries, almost a third have legal gaps in the area of overarching legal frameworks and public life (e.g., constitutions, antidiscrimination laws, quotas, legal aid); more than a quarter have legal gaps in the area of violence against women; and 29 per cent and 24 per cent have legal gaps in the employment and economic benefits area and in the marriage and family area, respectively.";;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
346;Based on data between 2000 and 2016 from about 90 countries, women spend roughly three times as many hours in unpaid domestic and care work as men.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
347;Women are still underrepresented in managerial positions. In the majority of the 67 countries with data from 2009 to 2015, fewer than a third of senior- and middle-management positions were held by women.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
348;"Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity. Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex (i.e., the state of being male, female, or an intersex variation), sex-based social structures (i.e., gender roles), or gender identity. Most cultures use a gender binary, having two genders (boys/men and girls/women); those who exist outside these groups fall under the umbrella term non-binary or genderqueer. Some societies have specific genders besides ""man"" and ""woman"", such as the hijras of South Asia; these are often referred to as third genders (and fourth genders, etc.).\nSexologist John Money introduced the terminological distinction between biological sex and gender as a role in 1955. Before his work, it was uncommon to use the word gender to refer to anything but grammatical categories. However, Money\'s meaning of the word did not become widespread until the 1970s, when feminist theory embraced the concept of a distinction between biological sex and the social construct of gender. Today, the distinction is followed in some contexts, especially the social sciences and documents written by the World Health Organization (WHO).In other contexts, including some areas of the social sciences, gender includes sex or replaces it.";;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
349;Goal 5 aims to achieve, by 2030, gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. This section focuses on women and girls with disabilities, analysing the international normative framework and providing an overview of their situation, as well as presenting national and international efforts to promote their inclusion and participation in society. The section concludes with suggestions on the way forward, based on current evidence.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
350;Empowering women and girls to reach their full potential requires that they have equal opportunities to those of men and boys. This means eliminating all forms of discrimination and violence against them, including violence by intimate partners, sexual violence and harmful practices, such as child marriage and female genital mutilation (FGM). Ensuring that women have better access to paid employment, sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights, and real decision-making power in public and private spheres will further ensure that development is equitable and sustainable.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
351;Consider the plight of a woman who has been raped, cast out of her home and community due to stigma, and forced to fend for herself and her dependent children in an environment of ongoing insecurity. This woman will confront greater threats and be forced to take greater risks because the basic needs of her family are not being met.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
352;This chapter will investigate several dimensions of violence against women and girls for which comparative data are available, beginning with female genital mutilation or cutting (FGM/C), violent forms of discipline and child marriage. It will also review data available on girls aged 15 to 19 reporting forced sex before turning 18, and the experiences of married or co-habiting girls dealing with emotional, physical or sexual violence committed by an intimate partner during the last 12 months. It will then examine attitudes towards husbands or partners beating their spouses held by both males and females aged between 15 and 49, as an important dimension explaining to some extent why violence towards women and girls is tolerated in some communities.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
353;"The world is a better place for women today than it was in the past. Fewer girls are forced into early marriage; more women are serving in parliament and positions of leadership; and laws are being reformed to advance gender equality. Despite these gains, discriminatory laws and social norms remain pervasive, along with harmful practices and other forms of violence against women and girls. Women continue to be underrepresented at all levels of political leadership. Across the globe, women and girls perform a disproportionate share of unpaid domestic work. Moreover, they continue to face barriers with respect to their sexual and reproductive health and rights, including legal restrictions and lack of autonomy in decision-making. Among the most disadvantaged are women and girls who face the compounded effects of gender and other forms of discrimination. Achieving gender equality will require bold and sustainable actions that address the structural impediments and root causes of discrimination against women. Equally important, it will require laws and policies that advance gender equality, backed by adequate resources, as well as stronger accountability for commitments made to women’s rights.";;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
354;Violence against women and girls (VAWG) takes many different forms. It is a universal problem on a shocking scale: No region, country or social group is free from it. In adopting the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action in 1993, and through subsequent intergovernmental agreements, governments have acknowledged that VAWG is “a manifestation of historically unequal power relations between men and women … [it] is one of the crucial social mechanisms by which women are forced into a subordinate position”. The strength of a feminist and human rights approach—clearly articulated in the General Recommendations of the Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination against Women (UN CEDAW)—is that it recognizes VAWG as a systematic form of discrimination against women rather than a series of unfortunate individual incidents or pathologies. Recognition of the systemic and structural nature of VAWG has gone hand in hand with defining state obligations to prevent and respond to it.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
355;Equal access to political power and leadership is critical to ensuring inclusive policies, national growth and development that benefits all. This chapter maps out current trends in the composition of legislatures across the OECD while exploring remaining barriers to women running for elected office and equal access to leadership positions in legislatures. It also provides an overview of strategies, initiatives and mechanisms across the OECD to help political institutions become more gender sensitive and thus encourage women’s political representation and access to leadership. Finally, the chapter assesses tools and frameworks to mainstream gender in the work of legislatures, including law-making and oversight.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
356;Closing persistent gender gaps in public and private spheres is an increasingly critical policy issue for OECD countries in their efforts to foster inclusive growth and opportunities for all. This chapter provides the rationale and the scope for the study. It also outlines the study’s objectives and details the methodology adopted in preparing the report.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
357;One in three women worldwide face some form of violence at least once in their lifetime. The HeForShe Champions are finding different and creative ways to break the cycle of harm. They are not just highlighting the problem and challenging attitudes. They are also exploring how established processes and structures can be adapted to reduce violence and to bring more women to the table when it comes to the peace and security agenda. The international community has recognized that women’s participation is vital to achieving and sustaining peace. HeForShe Champions are ready to lead the way.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
358;This report maps strategies, governance tools, institutional settings and innovative approaches used by governments across the OECD to drive and support society-wide gender equality goals. It covers all state institutions, including legislatures and judiciaries, and discusses the challenges faced by OECD countries in achieving long-lasting impact. Finally, the report provides policy guidance for state institutions, supported by examples of what works across the OECD. This report establishes a baseline for monitoring progress, based on the 2015 OECD Recommendation of the Council on Gender Equality in Public Life.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
359;Women continue to spend far more hours than men on unpaid childcare and housework, and in most OECD countries, women spend more total time on paid and unpaid work than men do.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
360;Sustainable Development Goal 5, to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, underscores the importance of improving gender equality and opportunities for sustainable development and how the negative impact of discrimination against women and girls can impede economic and social development. Gender equality is integral to sustainable development and an essential ingredient for economic progress. When women and girls have the means to fully participate in and contribute to socioeconomic development, direct and indirect benefits lead to the betterment of societies and nation States as a whole.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
361;This chapter focuses on the issue of domestic violence in the target countries, i.e. its symptoms, causes and legal and other responses by state organs to address domestic violence. The aim is to sensitise and enable judges and other stakeholders to make informed and human rights compliant decisions when dealing with cases of domestic violence.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
362;Mexico has a long way to go on the road to gender equality. Over the past two decades, Mexico has achieved some progress thanks to comprehensive laws strengthening women’s rights. However, entrenched acceptance of discriminatory social norms, legal loopholes and inadequate public support for working parents undermine gender equality. Although women’s educational attainment now matches men’s, fewer than half of working-age Mexican women are in the labour force. Nearly 60% of Mexico’s working women hold informal jobs, with little social protection and low pay. Mexico’s adolescent pregnancy rate remains five times as high as the OECD average, and the share of young women not in employment, education or training is nearly four times the rate for young men. Across all age groups, Mexican mothers are less likely to be employed than mothers in most OECD countries. Violence against women remains widespread. Aside from the moral imperative, greater gender equality will ensure a more efficient use of Mexico’s resources and promote sustainable inclusive growth.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
363;Globally, men are more exposed to informality than women, but the share of women in informal employment exceeds that of men in a majority of countries (Chapter 1). Across countries, however, risks and vulnerabilities associated with the informal economy (Chapter 3) disproportionately affect women. This chapter provides updated evidence on gender disparities in key informal employment outcomes, such as employment status and wage levels. It then examines the role of gender-based constraints in employment outcomes and access to social protection. Last, it reviews gender-sensitive approaches that have been instrumental in empowering women in the informal economy in a number of countries, with a view to identify priority areas for policy makers. It is evident that the vulnerability challenge in the informal economy needs to be addressed through a gender lens. In particular, gender-sensitive risk management instruments are critically needed to ensure that current attempts to extend social protection to informal economy workers do not leave women behind.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
364;This chapter presents an overview of women’s discrimination in the family. It examines discriminatory social institutions – formal and informal laws, social norms and practices – that limit women’s decision-making power and undervalue their status in the household across 180 countries, covering areas such as child marriage, household responsibilities, parental authority, divorce and inheritance. The chapter also seeks to provide policy makers with the necessary tools and evidence to design effective gender-responsive policies to tackle gender inequality in the family sphere.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
365;Gender inequality, conflict and fragility are key challenges to sustainable development. They are inextricably linked: unequal gender relations can drive conflict and violence, while women’s active participation in decision-making contributes to peace and resilience. This policy paper provides practical recommendations for donors and practitioners on how to integrate gender equality into programming in fragile and conflict-affected settings. It focuses on engaging men and boys and addressing masculinities in a transformative manner to change gendered power dynamics and achieve more equitable gender norms and peaceful outcomes.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
366;Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 5 of the 2030 Agenda calls for the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. Gender equality is a standalone Goal and is integral to achieving all the SDGs. Conversely, progress on other SDGs impacts gender equality outcomes.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
367;1 2017 HLPF Thematic review of SDG 5: Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls1 The gender-responsive implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development presents an enormous opportunity to achieve gender equality, end poverty and hunger, combat inequalities within and among countries, build peaceful, just and inclusive societies, protect and promote human rights, and ensure the lasting protection of the planet and its natural resources. The SDGs provide an important framework for collective action to achieve gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and the realization of their full enjoyment of all human rights. This work requires continued attention to the implementation of outcomes of major United Nations conferences and Summits, including the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development, as well as sustained implementation of international human rights treaties.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
368;Status of progress As part of the broader ongoing effort to highlight progress, gaps and challenges in SDG implementation, this section provides brief analyses of trend data for SDG 5 targets and status updates since the inaugural report of the Secretary-General on Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (E/2016/75). At this early stage, data is not yet available on trends that can illustrate SDG 5 implementation. 5.1: Some progress has been made in recent years to end discrimination against women and girls in laws, policies and practices, 2 but currently there is no comprehensive overview of data on legal frameworks in place to promote, enforce and monitor equality and non-discrimination on the basis of sex. Discriminatory constitutional and legislative provisions are still in place in many countries, including in family, divorce and personal laws, penal codes, nationality laws, and laws relating to inheritance and ownership and control over land and other resources.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
369;5.2: Violence against women and girls in private and public spaces is a persistent phenomenon that no country has managed to eliminate. Comparability of data regionally and globally remains a major challenge. Latest comparable data for 87 countries from 2005 to 2016, including 30 from developed regions, shows that 19 per cent of girls and women aged 15 to 49 years have experienced physical and/or sexual violence by an intimate partner in the past 12 months. Data also shows that one in three 1 1 This background note has been developed by members of ECESA Plus as a coordinated contribution by the UN system to the 2017 HLPF in depth review of SDG 5.

370;United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women (UN Women).   2 women experience physical and/or sexual violence by a partner or sexual violence by a non-partner in their lifetime. Women who have experienced intimate partner violence are 50 per cent more likely to acquire HIV than women who have not. 3 Data on prevalence of violence against women and girls with disabilities, women and girls from ethnic minorities, women migrant workers and women above the age of 49, who are not included in many violence against women surveys, is lacking despite such surveys having been conducted in more than 100 countries. 5.3: While the prevalence of child, early and forced marriage and female genital mutilation and cutting (FGM/C) has been gradually declining over the past three decades, rates are still unacceptably high. Over 750 million women and girls alive today were married before their 18th birthday, meaning that just over 1 in 4 young women were married in childhood, which indicates a decline from nearly 1 in 3 around 1990.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
371;4 Although uneven across regions and countries, progress on marriage of girls under 15 years, which has declined from 11 per cent in 1990 to 8 per cent today – representing an average annual rate of reduction twice that of marriage by age 18. Rates of FGM/C have declined by 30 per cent overall, but progress is not universal and the pace of decline is uneven. At least 200 million girls have undergone FGM/C in the 30 countries with representative prevalence data, or more than one third of girls aged 15 to 19 today, compared with nearly one in two in the mid-1980s. 5 Collecting consistent and reliable data on FGM/C is challenging due to the sensitive nature of the issue, and despite enhanced surveying on FGM/C in relevant countries, data sets are not necessarily comparable as different methodologies are used across and within countries. 5.4: Women and girls perform the bulk of unpaid care and domestic work, including caregiving and household tasks, in every region.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
372;On average, women spend 19 per cent of their time daily on unpaid care work, compared with 8 per cent for men. This disproportionate share of unpaid care and domestic work, together with paid labour, means women and girls work longer hours and have less time for rest, self-care, learning, and other activities, such as political participation. 5.5: Parliamentary elections were held in 53 countries in 2016, which led to an increase in the global average of women in national parliaments, from 22.6 per cent in 2015 to 23.3 per cent in December 2016. 6 This constitutes a modest 6.5 percentage point gain in ten years. Women remain underrepresented in managerial positions, especially in senior and middle management. In the past decade, the share of women in senior and middle management positions increased in only 44 per cent of the countries with available data. 7 The proportion of women in managerial positions in media have declined from 28 per cent in 2010 to 27 per cent in 2015.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;

374;9 5.6: Women’s access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights is often limited by legal and other barriers, such as restrictions by marital status, third party authorization and age. 10 Lack of supportive legislation is also a challenge, particularly to enable access for marginalized groups, such as migrants and indigenous women. The impact of legal barriers can be evidenced in women’s ability to make their own decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use, HIV prevention and health care. Only 50 percent of women, aged 15-49 years, married or in union, make their own decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and health care, according to data available from 45 countries. 11 Currently there is no comprehensive overview of data on laws and regulations that guarantee women and men aged 15 and older full and equal access to sexual and reproductive health care, information and education. 5.a: Control over and ownership of assets can provide women with greater protection and enhance their bargaining power within the household and their capacity for economic independence. Gender differences in land tenure and access to productive resources are particularly relevant, as rural women are significant contributors to global food production.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
375;Gains associated with eliminating the gender gap in agriculture can potentially increase national production by 2.5 to 4 per cent, as suggested from countries where data is available, and can potentially lead to associated declines in rates of undernourishment of 12 to 17 per cent. 12 Data on women’s access to economic resources, including land, property and financial services, remains limited and not internationally comparable. 5.b: The spread of new technologies, particularly mobile phones and internet, has increased opportunities to communicate, and access information and services. However, women in developing countries face unique challenges in accessing information and communication technology (ICT) to unlock educational and employment opportunities. In low and middle income countries women are 21 per cent less likely to own a mobile phone than men.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
376;In 2016, women’s internet use was 12.2 per cent lower than men’s, with a significantly higher gap in LDCs (30.9 per cent). The global gender digital divide has widened by 1.2 per cent since 2013, equivalent to a total gap of some 257 million more men online than women. This has an impact on the way in which goods and services are created, produced, distributed and accessed in the digital environment. Women are not adequately represented as stakeholders, co-creators, and beneficiaries of technology-based interventions and often lack access to technology, digital skills, and media and information literacy. 5.c: There is a need to significantly increase investments for gender equality and track public allocations for gender equality. Of the 80 countries with available data, only 47 per cent have systems in place to 9 Women in Science.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;

378;13 Transparency in gender tracking systems is critical for effective policy formulation and for accountability. Principal interlinkages of SDG 5 with other goals and how they impact policy-making The 2030 Agenda takes a holistic approach to addressing the challenges of sustainable development, and prioritizes gender equality as a standalone goal and a cross-cutting issue, without which the overarching aims of the Agenda cannot be realized. The SDG framework includes comprehensive commitments across the board that contribute to the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls and in this regard policy decisions should harness these interlinkages. The following mutually reinforcing linkages between SDG 5 and other SDGs, while not intended to be exhaustive, demonstrate how implementation of targets across the framework significantly contributes to outcomes for women and girls.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
379;Ending all forms of discrimination: Ending discrimination against women and girls (5.1, 5.c, 10.3, and 16.b) is a prerequisite to achieving many other SDGs, such as ensuring equal access to quality and affordable education at all levels (4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4, 4.5, 4.6, 5.1, 5.5), access to the labour market (8.3, 8.5), and political participation (5.5 and 10.2). Ending all forms of discrimination empowers women and girls to contribution to poverty eradication (1) and promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development (16), and promotes women’s engagement in trade activities, the formation of small enterprises and their access to full and productive employment and decent work, including equal pay for equal work or work of equal value (8.3 and 8.5). Eliminating violence and harmful practices: Eliminating all forms of violence against women and girls is central to the overall achievement of gender equality, as well as the eradication of poverty and the achievement of sustainable development, peace and security and human rights (5.2, 5.3, 16.1, 16.2).;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
380;Measures in other SDG targets demonstrate the important contribution of the SDG framework to the elimination of violence against women and girls, including through promoting a culture of peace and non-violence (4.7), and providing safe public spaces (11.7) and transport (11.2). In addition, registering girls at birth (16.9) and recording their marriages provides legal backing against harmful practices, including child, early and forced marriage (5.3). Promoting economic empowerment and financing: The promotion of women’s economic empowerment is prominent across several SDG targets, particularly with a focus on poverty eradication, women’s and girls’ education, equal rights for women and men to social protection systems, economic and productive resources and gender-sensitive development strategies (1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4, 1.b, 2.3, 4.1, 4.3, 4.5 and 5.a). Ensuring women's economic rights, including women’s equal opportunities to organize for better wages and working conditions, and improving their access to land and resources, including financial services and control over income, is critical to achieving full and productive employment and decent work (8.5 and 9.5) and contributes to peaceful and inclusive societies (16).;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
381;Women’s access to decent work (8) is often hampered by the disproportionate share of time devoted to unpaid care and domestic work (5.4), thus linked to lack of available infrastructure and technology (9.1 and 9.4). Supporting enterprise growth, generating employment and promoting sustainable industrial 13 “Making development co-operation more effective.” Global Partnership for Effective Development Co-operation. (2016)   5 development (9.2) requires financial services, including affordable credit, and women’s integration in value chains and markets (9.3). Volatile and rising food prices have a detrimental impact on women’s access to food, which underlines the importance of policies to prevent food price hikes, and the need for governments to ensure the affordability and accessibility of food (2.3).;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
382;Trade liberalization (17.11, 17.12) in labour-abundant economies can support the transition from agriculture to industry and services. Implementation of gender equality targets requires adequate financing from all sources, including domestic resources, private sector financing and official development assistance (17.3). Ensuring participation and leadership in decision-making: Women’s full and effective participation in leadership and decision-making, in political, economic and public life (5.5) is a strong enabler for other SDG targets, including those on water and sanitation resource management, reducing inequalities, and promoting peaceful and inclusive societies (6.b and 16.7). Women’s full participation in economic and political life (5.5 and 16.7) can increase productivity, create decent work (8.3 and 8.5), enhance agricultural productivity in smallholder farms (2.3), and strengthen women’s agency in making decisions about their health and rights (3.1, 3.3, 3.7 and 5.6).;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
383;Women’s full and equal participation is also critical to contribute to climate-change related planning and management (13.b) and the sustainable use and management of terrestrial ecosystems (15.1 and15.2), taking into account the specific knowledge of indigenous women. Ensuring healthy lives: Access to sexual and reproductive health and reproductive rights (5.6) and sexual and reproductive health services (3.7) are directly linked to the reduction of maternal mortality (3.1), and ending communicable diseases such as HIV and AIDS (3.3). Women’s and girls’ lack of autonomy and decision-making over their sexual and reproductive health can severely limit their economic and other outcomes, such as education (4), employment (8) and their ability to promote peaceful and inclusive societies (16).;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
384;Further, women’s critical roles in the global health workforce, comprising 67 per cent across 123 countries, provide a strong link between investing in the health workforce (3.c), recognizing and valuing unpaid care and domestic work (5.4) and achieving full and productive employment and decent work (8.5). Improving sanitation and hygiene addresses the needs of women and girls, including menstrual hygiene, and contributes to realizing several goals (3, 4, 5, 8). Detailed look at implementation Since the adoption of the 2030 Agenda, Member States have put in place mechanisms to support the implementation of the SDGs. In some cases, governments have established inter-ministerial committees to strengthen implementation efforts through policy coordination and coherence. Governments have taken steps to integrate the SDGs into national sustainable development strategies, and in this regard, have assessed existing national capacities for implementing and monitoring the SDGs, including financial resources and statistical capacity.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
385;In an effort to strengthen institutional effectiveness to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls, some Member States have strengthened the mandates of national mechanisms for the promotion of gender equality (Australia and Philippines), and set up local level gender equality 6 mechanisms (Bosnia Herzegovina, Georgia and Nepal). 14 Member States have prioritized gender mainstreaming in SDG implementation through establishing gender equality as a cross-cutting priority in national sustainable development plans (Mexico, Paraguay and Qatar), and making gender mainstreaming a central strategy for development policies (Kenya). In the context of strengthening national statistical capacities to monitor the implementation of SDG 5 some Member States have enhanced inter-agency mechanisms on gender statistics (Colombia, Cuba and the Philippines),;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
386;or strengthened gender statistics focal points in their national statistics offices (Jamaica and Norway). In this regard, Member States have also made progress in developing and enhancing methodologies for measuring different forms of gender-based discrimination, including on violence against women (Albania, Argentina, Mexico, the Philippines, Paraguay, Peru, Spain and Sri Lanka) and on unpaid care work (Kenya, Mexico, Peru and the Philippines) through, in particular, time use surveys. 15 Challenges identified for implementation at the national level Despite extensive efforts made by governments to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls through enacting legal frameworks, women and girls continue to be subjected to discrimination, violence and harmful practices and denied the full realization of their human rights.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
387;Throughout the world, women face barriers in realizing their economic rights, due to entrenched gender stereotypes and negative social norms that limit women’s equal access to land, property and financial services, and which in turn shape outcomes for women related to labour markets, entrepreneurship and innovation. The promotion of gender stereotypes through the media remains a challenge to achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls. The lack of adequate infrastructure and access to information and communications technologies for women and girls limits their educational opportunities and access to labour markets. Women’s ability to decide freely on their sexual and reproductive health, in some cases, is undermined by third-party consent requirements and restrictions on essential information and health services and contraceptive services. Inadequate resources for the implementation of national action plans on gender equality and other gender equality policies is a significant challenge across all countries.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
388;While governments are increasingly adopting gender-responsive budgeting and monitoring public expenditures on gender equality, the impact of such efforts is reduced when overall budgets for gender equality policies and the provision of services, social protection and infrastructure are inadequate. Chronic under-investment in rural infrastructure and technology has a disproportionately negative impact for women living in rural areas, as women often engage in time consuming unpaid care work, including fetching water and fuel, which prevents them from engaging in paid work. One of the key challenges that hampers the implementation and monitoring of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls at the national level is the lack of adequate gender-sensitive data, including data disaggregated by sex, age and other relevant characteristics in national contexts.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
389;Of the 230 unique global SDG indicators, currently 53 (23 per cent) make explicit reference to women, girls, 14 Report of the Secretary-General on the Review of the implementation of the agreed conclusions from the fifty-eight session of the Commission on the Status of Women (E/CN.6/2017/4) 15 Ibid. 7 gender or sex, including the 14 indicators under SDG 5. In addition, many gender-related indicators in other SDGs currently lack methodologies for data collection to support comprehensive and periodic monitoring. Such lack of data on key areas of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls weakens the ability of Member States and other stakeholders to develop evidence-based policies. The absence of statistics in these areas may be attributed to a lack of prioritizing gender equality in data collection and from a lack of resources.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
390;Targeted actions by governments, development agencies, civil society organizations and communities, including through improved funding, can enhance the collection, analysis and use of gender statistics, including sex-disaggregated data, in areas such as poverty, education, health, employment, social protection, income distribution within households, unpaid care and domestic work, violence against women and girls, and women’s access to, control over, and ownership of assets and resources, including water. Opportunities identified for implementation There are important opportunities at the local, national, regional and global levels that governments and other stakeholders can leverage to promote the gender-responsive implementation of the 2030 Agenda. At the local level, a focus on improved local government service delivery and spending on the greatest gaps can help overcome gender-inequality.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
391;At national level, eliminating gender-based inequalities in legal frameworks and policies should be a key priority, together with strengthening of national gender equality mechanisms to ensure their leadership and effective contribution to the implementation of the SDGs, including by placing such mechanisms at the highest possible level of government with increased authority, capacity and funding. At regional and global levels, governments can utilize existing mechanisms to demonstrate progress toward the implementation of gender equality commitments, including reporting under the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW) by States parties. The quinquennial reviews of the Beijing Platform for Action and the Programme of Action of the International Conference on Population and Development are also opportunities to assess progress in implementation of SDG 5, identify regional trends and opportunities for peer learning as well as identify gaps and challenges in implementation.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
392;Stakeholder engagement The implementation of the SDGs provides an opportunity for decision-makers to embed the multi- stakeholder principles of the 2030 Agenda into their policy agendas and promote coordinated efforts with civil society, the private sector, the United Nations system and other actors. Close monitoring through participatory processes will be essential for ensuring the effective implementation of the SDGs. Active civil society participation and involvement in decision-making at the national level, including by women’s organizations, women’s human rights defenders and youth-led organizations should be an integral part of such efforts. During the elaboration of the 2030 Agenda, women’s organizations were particularly effective in building coalitions and alliances across different interest groups, and implementation should build on their involvement. Engaging the private sector to implement relevant components will also be crucial, including through the provision of technical and financial support for programming.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
393;National human rights institutions, can provide an important contribution by ensuring implementation of national development plans adhere to human rights principles. 8 UN system To address data gaps in monitoring the implementation of SDG 5 and other gender-related targets, the United Nations system is stepping up its efforts to help countries close gender data gaps through direct technical and financial support and has strengthened its internal coordination mechanisms to effectively support Member States. United Nations entities are also leading the collection of data for various SDG indicators as well as the development of methodologies and standards for indicators for which methodologies and standards do not yet exist. At its session in March 2017, the UN Statistical Commission reviewed and endorsed the methodology to measure asset ownership from a gender perspective developed through the Evidence and Data for Gender Equality (EDGE) programme, paving the way for more consistent data collection in the future.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
394; In areas where acute data gaps have been identified such as sex, disability and age disaggregated data, various initiatives are underway to improve data production and use. Additionally, the creation of an Inter-Agency Group on Violence against Women Data and its Technical Advisory Group will facilitate the compilation of harmonized country level data on violence against women, which will support global reporting on violence against women and girls, including in the context of SDG implementation. Similarly, the UN Joint Programme on Essential Services for Victims and Survivors of Violence, the Gender-Sensitive Indicators for Media and the World Water Assessment Programme, have worked to strengthen gender data collection. The United Nations system has also developed joint programmes and other collaborative efforts to support coordinated approaches to gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, including through the Inter-Agency Network on Women and Gender Equality (IANWGE).;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
395;"Joint programmes to support governments and other stakeholders include: the UNFPA/UNICEF Joint Programme on Female Genital Mutilation/Cutting; the UNFPA/UNICEF Global Programme to Accelerate Action to End Child Marriage; the Joint Programme on Empowering Adolescent Girls and Young Women through Education; the High-level Working Group on Health and Human Rights; the High-level Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth and the ILO/OECD/WHO Working for Health Programme; the Inter-Agency Working Group on Gender Equality and HIV; the UN System Network on Rural Development and Food Security; the Inter-agency Task Force on Violence Against Women; the United Nations Joint Global Programme on Essential Services for Women and Girls Subject to Violence; the Global Alliance on Media and Gender; the Island Women Open Network for Sustainable Energy and Climate Resilience in Island Nations;";;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
396;and the Joint Global Programme on Inclusive and Equitable Local Development. Recommendations Areas where gaps exist As governments and other stakeholders continue to implement SDG 5, concerted efforts will be needed to address existing gaps in implementation, particularly regarding structural barriers to gender equality, strengthening accountability mechanisms at the national level, increasing investment and financing for gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, and increasing data collection capacity. 9 Governments should place greater focus on policies that address the structural, power and political dynamics that perpetuate discrimination against women and girls and are barriers to gender equality, especially against women and girls facing multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
397;Emphasis should be placed on removing and repealing discriminatory legal frameworks, implementing policies that promote women’s labour force participation, including through women and girls’ equal access to education at primary, secondary and tertiary levels, measures to recognize, reduce and redistribute unpaid care work, and ensuring universal health coverage including sexual and reproductive health and universal social protection and services.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;
398;In the implementation of SDG 5, specific attention must be given to building accountability mechanisms into interventions and strategies, monitoring the functioning and effectiveness of those mechanisms and processes and taking remedial action to ensure that they are responsive to the rights of women and girls. Establishing and maintaining such accountability mechanisms requires dedicated and sustained resources. Significantly increased investment to close resource gaps for achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, including through the mobilization of financial resources from all sources, will be required to address existing gaps in the implementation of SDG 5.;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;;

421;WATER AND CLIMATE CHANGE The contents were contributed by the UN-Water Members and Partners, and others on the title pages of the chapters therein. UNESCO and the UNESCO World Water Assessment Programme (WWAP)219 iv The United Nations World Water Development Report 2020 Water and Climate Change Foreword by Audrey Azoulay, Director-General of UNESCO The climate is changing, and our world is in danger. Around one million animal and plant species are facing extinction. Freshwater species have suffered the greatest decline, falling by 84% since 1970. Humans are also affected: around four billion people currently experience severe physical water scarcity for at least one month per year, a situation that has been exacerbated by the climate crisis. As the planet warms, water has become one of the main ways we experience climate change. And yet the word “water” rarely appears in international climate agreements, even though it plays a key role in issues such as food security, energy production, economic development and poverty reduction. This potential of water must be explored, given that our actions to reduce global warming are currently lagging behind our ambitions, despite wide adherence to the Paris Agreement. That is the goal of the 2020 World Water Development Report on water and climate change. The report shows that water does not need to be a problem – it can be part of the solution. Water can support efforts to both mitigate and adapt to climate change.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
422;Wetland protection, conservation agriculture and other nature-based solutions can help to sequester carbon in biomass and soils. Improved wastewater treatment can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions and produce biogas as a source of renewable energy. Coordinated and produced by UNESCO, this report is the result of close and continued collaboration within the UN-Water family. It was made possible thanks to the Government of Italy and the Regione Umbria, which have long supported the World Water Assessment Programme. I wish to thank all those who participated in this common endeavour. Water is not just about development – it is a basic human right. It is essential to peace and security around the world. Addressing the issue of water is not a task to be taken lightly. We must rise to this challenge if we are to leave behind a world that future generations can live in. Audrey Azoulay v Climate change affects – and is affected by – global water resources. It reduces the predictability of water availability and affects water quality. Climate change also increases the occurrence of extreme weather events, threatening sustainable social-economic development and biodiversity worldwide. This, in turn, has profound implications for water resources. As such, climate change exacerbates the ever-growing challenges associated with the sustainable management of water. ;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;

429;6.a By 2030, expand international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water- and sanitation-related activities and programmes, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
430;6.b Support and strengthen the participation of local communities in improving water and sanitation management;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
431;Globally, the proportion of population using safely managed drinking water services increased from 61 to 71 per cent between 2000 and 2015 and remained unchanged in 2017. An additional 19 per cent of the global population used basic drinking water services. This means that 785 million people still lacked even a basic drinking water service.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
432;In 2017, some 60 per cent of people worldwide and only 38 per cent in least developed countries had a basic handwashing facility with soap and water at home, leaving an estimated 3 billion people without basic handwashing facilities at home.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
433;In 2016, one third of all primary schools lacked basic drinking water, sanitation and hygiene services, affecting the education of millions of schoolchildren, but particularly girls managing menstruation, and one in four health-care facilities worldwide lacked basic water services, affecting more than 2 billion people.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
434;Approximately one third of countries have medium or high levels of water stress. Almost all countries that have registered high water stress are located in North Africa and West Asia or in Central and South Asia, and these levels indicate serious water difficulties in the supply of freshwater, at least during parts of the year.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
435;A significant effort is needed to ensure that cooperation is operational in all transboundary basins. According to data from 67 of 153 countries that share transboundary waters, the average percentage of national transboundary basins covered by an operational arrangement was 59 per cent in the period 2017–2018, with only 17 countries reporting that all their transboundary basins were covered by such arrangements.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
436;In 2015, 29 per cent of the global population lacked safely managed drinking water supplies, and 61 per cent were without safely managed sanitation services. In 2015, 892 million people continued to practise open defecation.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
437;In 2015, only 27 per cent of the population in LDCs had basic handwashing facilities.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
438;More than 2 billion people globally are living in countries with excess water stress, defined as the ratio of total freshwater withdrawn to total renewable freshwater resources above a threshold of 25 per cent. Northern Africa and Western Asia experience water stress levels above 60 per cent, which indicates the strong probability of future water scarcity.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
439;Effective water and sanitation management relies on the participation of a range of stakeholders, including local communities. A 2016-2017 survey found that over 80 per cent of 74 responding countries had clearly defined procedures for engaging service users/communities in water and sanitation management.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
440;Holistic management of the water cycle means taking into account the level of “water stress”, calculated as the ratio of total fresh water withdrawn by all major sectors to the total renewable fresh water resources in a particular country or region. Currently, water stress affects more than 2 billion people around the world, a figure that is projected to rise. Already, water stress affects countries on every continent and hinders the sustainability of natural resources, as well as economic and social development. In 2011, 41 countries experienced water stress, an increase from 36 countries in 1998. Of those, 10 countries, on the Arabian Peninsula, in Central Asia and in Northern Africa, withdrew more than 100 per cent of their renewable fresh water resources.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
441;"Sanitation refers to public health conditions related to clean drinking water and adequate treatment and disposal of human excreta and sewage. Preventing human contact with feces is part of sanitation, as is hand washing with soap. Sanitation systems aim to protect human health by providing a clean environment that will stop the transmission of disease, especially through the fecal–oral route. For example, diarrhea, a main cause of malnutrition and stunted growth in children, can be reduced through sanitation. There are many other diseases which are easily transmitted in communities that have low levels of sanitation, such as ascariasis (a type of intestinal worm infection or helminthiasis), cholera, hepatitis, polio, schistosomiasis, and trachoma, to name just a few.\nA range of sanitation technologies and approaches exists. Some examples are community-led total sanitation, container-based sanitation, ecological sanitation, emergency sanitation, environmental sanitation, onsite sanitation and sustainable sanitation. A sanitation system includes the capture, storage, transport, treatment and disposal or reuse of human excreta and wastewater. Reuse activities within the sanitation system may focus on the nutrients, water, energy or organic matter contained in excreta and wastewater. This is referred to as the ""sanitation value chain"" or ""sanitation economy"". The people responsible for cleaning, maintaining, operating, or emptying a sanitation technology at any step of the sanitation chain are called ""sanitation workers"".Several sanitation ""levels"" are being used to compare sanitation service levels within countries or across countries. The sanitation ladder defined by the Joint Monitoring Programme in 2016 starts at open defecation and moves upwards using the terms ""unimproved"", ""limited"", ""basic"", with the highest level being ""safely managed"". This is particularly applicable to developing countries.\nThe Human Right to Water and Sanitation was recognized by the United Nations (UN) General Assembly in 2010. Sanitation is a global development priority and the subject of Sustainable Development Goal 6. The estimate in 2017 by JMP states that 4.5 billion people currently do not have safely managed sanitation. Lack of access to sanitation has an impact not only on public health but also on human dignity and personal safety";;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
442;Water supply is the provision of water by public utilities, commercial organisations, community endeavors or by individuals, usually via a system of pumps and pipes. Irrigation is covered separately;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
443;A water distribution system is a part of water supply network with components that carry potable water from a centralized treatment plant or wells to water consumers in order to adequately deliver water to satisfy residential, commercial, industrial and fire fighting requirements.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
444;Irrigation is the process of applying controlled amounts of water to plants at needed intervals. Irrigation helps to  grow agricultural crops, maintain landscapes, and revegetate disturbed soils in dry areas and during periods of less than average rainfall. Irrigation also has other uses in crop production, including frost protection, suppressing weed growth in grain fields and preventing soil consolidation. In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed.\nIrrigation systems are also used for cooling livestock, dust suppression, disposal of sewage, and in mining. Irrigation is often studied together with drainage, which is the removal of surface and sub-surface water from a given area.\n\nIrrigation has been a central feature of agriculture for over 5,000 years and is the product of many cultures. Historically, it was the basis for economies and societies across the globe, from Asia to the Southwestern United States.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
445;"A body of water or waterbody (often spelled water body) is any significant accumulation of water, generally on a planet's surface. The term most often refers to oceans, seas, and lakes, but it includes smaller pools of water such as ponds, wetlands, or more rarely, puddles. A body of water does not have to be still or contained; rivers, streams, canals, and other geographical features where water moves from one place to another are also considered bodies of water.Most are naturally occurring geographical features, but some are artificial. There are types that can be either. For example, most reservoirs are created by engineering dams, but some natural lakes are used as reservoirs. Similarly, most harbors are naturally occurring bays, but some harbors have been created through construction.\nBodies of water that are navigable are known as waterways. Some bodies of water collect and move water, such as rivers and streams, and others primarily hold water, such as lakes and oceans.\nThe term body of water can also refer to a reservoir of water held by a plant, technically known as a phytotelma.\nBodies of water are affected by gravity which is what creates the tidal effects on Earth.";;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
446;Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 calls on governments and all stakeholders to: Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all. This goal goes beyond drinking water, sanitation and hygiene and also addresses the quality and sustainability of water resources. The target for the first Ten-Year Implementation Plan of Agenda 2063 is to reduce the 2013 levels of the proportion of people without access to safe drinking water and poor sanitation by 95 per cent. Access to water and sanitation are considered core socio-economic and health indicators, as well as key determinants of child survival, maternal and children’s health, family wellbeing and economic productivity. Improved drinking water, sanitation and hygiene play a major role in the progress in health, education and poverty reduction, and are thus used in constructing wealth indexes in household survey analyses of inequalities between rich and poor.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
447;Fresh water is a precious resource that is essential to human health, food and energy security, poverty eradication and many other aspects of sustainable development. Water-related ecosystems have always provided natural sites for human settlements, along with a wealth of ecosystem services. Yet, like other natural resources, water is under threat. The demand for water has outpaced population growth, and half the world’s population is already experiencing severe water scarcity at least one month a year. Most rivers in Africa, Asia and Latin America are more polluted now than they were in the 1990s. An estimated 50 to 70 per cent of the world’s natural wetland area has been lost over the last 100 years. While substantial progress has been made in increasing access to clean drinking water and sanitation, billions of people—mostly in rural areas—still lack these basic services. In response, donors increased their aid commitments to the water sector by 37 per cent between 2016 and 2017. Most countries have recognized the importance of better coordinating the use of water resources, and have put in place integrated plans for their management. However, much more effort is needed to improve access to water and sanitation services, increase wastewater treatment, enhance water use efficiency, expand operational cooperation across transboundary water basins, and protect and restore freshwater ecosystems.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
448;More than 2 billion people globally are living in countries with excess water stress, whilst an estimated 946 million people lack adequate sanitation facilities and continue to practise open defecation. The unsafe management of faecal waste and wastewater presents a major risk to public health and the environment. International standards are created for agencies that are accountable for developing, implementing and enforcing national or subnational policies on clean water and sanitation. They are instruments that have influenced the revision of national policies to improve clean water and sanitation.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
449;Sustainable water resources are essential to human health, environmental sustainability and economic prosperity. This vital resource is under threat, making it crucial to address the challenges related to water, sanitation and hygiene for populations and water-related ecosystems. Currently, more than 2 billion people are affected by water stress, which will only increase with population growth and the effects of climate change. Achieving universal access to drinking water, sanitation and hygiene and ensuring that services are safely managed remain major challenges, and meeting them is crucial to further progress in health, education and poverty eradication.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
450;The Prologue provides a brief overview of two core aspects of the state of the world’s water resources that are directly related to wastewater: water availability and ambient water quality. While adequately treated wastewater is a resource that can be used to address water supply shortages, the level of wastewater treatment directly affects ambient water quality, with implications on water availability. The external drivers that will dictate future trends in water availability and quality are described, with a special focus on demographic dynamics and climate change.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
451;At the start of the seventy-second session of the General Assembly of the United Nations I emphasized our common goal: peace and a decent life for all people on a sustainable planet. Many leaders echoed this overarching priority at the general debate and beyond. One very important element of this is universal access to water and sanitation. At a most basic level, human beings cannot survive without water. Equally important is sanitation, a lack of which negatively affects our quality of life and claims the lives of millions each year.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
452;This chapter presents the main trends in water quality, progress in achieving (ambitious) water quality objectives, the challenges ahead and the health effects of poor water quality. It discusses the regulatory framework for water resource management, including at the watershed scale. It reviews pricing and infrastructure development for water supply and sanitation. Finally, the chapter discusses the role of direct regulations and economic instruments in water management and proposes a risk-based approach to water management.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
453;This chapter presents the case of France on DDC to promote access to drinking water and sanitation. The city-to-city DDC is particularly prominent in the field of water in France. The approach includes both ODA and non-ODA support and is based on a peer-to-peer partnership between municipalities or basin agencies in promoter country and their peers in the partner country. The case of France highlights the importance of an enabling regulatory framework and incentives and how a dedicated DDC funding mechanism - allowing mobilising 1% of LRGs revenues for water-related activities - can act as a leverage and multiplier effect to mobilise other sources of funding and support in partner countries.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
454;This chapter describes various institutional, technical and financial mechanisms for controlling and preventing the discharge of pollutants into wastewater streams and reducing wastewater volumes.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
455;This chapter describes the need for market reforms and discusses options available to the sanitation sector in Armenia. The chapter presents the fragmentation of the sanitation sector in Armenia and the impact this has on sector efficiency and impact upon public health and environmental performance as a key driver for reform. Five modes of service supply are explored with recommendations made on the implementation of the preferred model including the role of Government and incentives in the reform process.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
456;Morocco has limited potential with respect to water resources and faces substantial challenges in that regard. An uneven distribution of water in space and time is the main feature of the hydrological regime. Yearly precipitation may diverge significantly (almost on a 1:10 ratio) and the same asymmetry may be observed among water basins in the course of the hydrological year. Furthermore, similarly to most Mediterranean countries, Morocco has experienced severe droughts in recent decades with occasional extreme precipitation episodes and disastrous flash floods. The water quality is also questionable.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
457;This chapter takes stock of recent information and data on challenges related to water quality in OECD countries. It zooms in on the water quality issues facing OECD cities, the effects of water quantity and climate change on water quality, and the ongoing challenge of managing diffuse pollution, in particular, nutrient loading.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
458;Sustainable management of water and sanitation, and the availability of clean, accessible water for all are essential components for constructing the kind of world in which people would want to live. Failure to ensure the availability of safe drinking water and basic levels of sanitation would hinder any efforts to ensure healthy lives and promote well-being.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
459;Global freshwater demand is projected to increase substantially in the coming decades, making water one of the most fiercely contested resources on the planet. Water is linked to many economic activities, and there are complex channels through which water affects economic growth. The purpose of this report is to provide background information useful for a quantitative global assessment of the impact of water scarcity on growth using a multi-region, recursive-dynamic, Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. The paper provides a detailed review of the literature on water, water scarcity, sectoral activity and economic growth, and identifies the possibilities and bottlenecks in incorporating water use into a CGE framework. It covers agricultural water consumption, with special attention to irrigation, water use in energy production, and demands for water by households, industry and services. Finally, it discusses water supply and allocation. Based on the evidence assembled, there appear to have been relatively few instances in which water scarcity has significantly slowed the long term rate of national economic growth. Furthermore, in reviewing the literature on water demand, the ample opportunities for conserving water across the board are striking, including in the electric power sector, the production of industrial steam, residential consumption, and irrigated agriculture. In our opinion, the main reason why such substitution has not been more widespread to date is due to the absence of economic incentives for conservation. The presence of large inter-sectoral distortion heightens the need for general equilibrium analysis. But implementation of a global CGE model with detailed representation of water demand and supply will be a significant undertaking. It is essential to break out water from the other inputs in the CGE model, treat water as both an input and an output, and add sectoral detail, with special attention to crop irrigation. Furthermore, there are challenges in assigning appropriate values to water and specifying allocation rules for dealing with water scarcity.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
460;"n many cases, current national and local water governance frameworks are failing to deliver equitable access for a number of reasons, including broader governance frameworks that undermine efforts in the water sector; weak water governance and management resulting in poor sector performance; and water governance frameworks being “equity blind”.";;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
461;The Northern Region of Thailand contains 17 individual provinces each of which presents unique challenges with regard to water management. Expansion of the tourism sector in Chiang Mai is linked to issues of water quality, growth in the agricultural and manufacturing sectors in Tak presents difficulties related to water allocation, and seasonal variations in precipitation are at the root cause of low water levels in the Mekong River Basin that impact navigation and export opportunities in Chiang Rai. Tackling these varied water management challenges requires a strong vision and water strategy on the part of central government as well as empowered local actors to deliver against their mandate. This chapter presents policy recommendations that intend to improve organisation, policy coherence and decision making, and take a long-term, risk-based approach to infrastructure development and water security.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
462;Turkey has achieved progress over the last decade by increasing the share of population connected to sewerage and to wastewater treatment infrastructure. It has also invested significantly in river basin planning. This integrated approach to planning needs to be leveraged to help Turkey achieve its ambitious goals for urban wastewater management in the short to medium term. The chapter describes these achievements and barriers to achieving the urban wastewater management goals, and suggests opportunities for improvement.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
463;This chapter reports recent trends in water use indicators in the agricultural sector of OECD countries and illustrates some of the main drivers such as market developments, water infrastructure, irrigation technologies, and water policies. Case studies of France, Turkey and the United States highlight the relevance of these drive;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
464;Groundwater protection remains one of the challenges for water resources management and protection, and in particular for water supply, since most water for human consumption relies upon groundwater from karstic aquifers. Another challenge is coastal zone management, where the introduction of integrated management is required, along with protection of aquatic ecosystems and bathing waters. Water allocation also represents a challenge as the requirements of nature conservation and biodiversity protection may collide with opportunities for economic development. Good planning and management is important to ensure sustainable water resources management, including fulfilling the needs of ecosystems and social expectations.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
465;Since independence, Singapore grasped the necessity for diversification of its water supply to be able to meet future needs. While plans for water recycling emerged in the 1970s, cost and reliability concerns then suspended such activities until the maturation of membrane technology in the 1990s, allowing Singapore’s national water agency to revisit its plans for water recycling. In 2000, a full-scale demonstration plant was commissioned. This was followed by a comprehensive water sampling and analysis programme to determine the feasibility and dependability of water recycling for potable use. The first two water recycling plants were opened in 2003, accompanied by an awareness-raising and educational campaign to inform the public about the safety and purity of recycled water, branded ‘NEWater’. Thanks to continual investments by the government in water research and development and strong political will to achieve long-term water sustainability as well as national resilience against water scarcity, NEWater was successfully introduced and accepted by the public.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
466;Guaranteeing safely managed clean water and sanitation for everyone remains one of the biggest global challenges that are solvable in our lifetimes. But we must prioritize collaboration and monitoring.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;
467;Water plays a crucial role in the development of mankind. From time immemorial people have settled near water, which has always been a source of life and well-being. Humanity has praised and glorified it as a sacred resource for thousands of years.;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;;

493;7.b By 2030, expand infrastructure and upgrade technology for supplying modern and sustainable energy services for all in developing countries, in particular least developed countries, small island developing States, and land-locked developing countries, in accordance with their respective programmes of support;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
494;The global electrification rate rose from 83 per cent in 2010 to 87 per cent in 2015, with the increase accelerating to reach 89 per cent in 2017. However, some 840 million people around the world are still without access to electricity.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
495;The global share of the population with access to clean cooking fuels and technologies reached 61 per cent in 2017, up from 57 per cent in 2010. Despite this progress, close to 3 billion people still rely primarily on inefficient and polluting cooking systems.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
496;The renewable energy share of total final energy consumption gradually increased from 16.6 per cent in 2010 to 17.5 per cent in 2016, though much faster change is required to meet climate goals. Even though the absolute level of renewable energy consumption has grown by more than 18 per cent since 2010, only since 2012 has the growth of renewables outpaced the growth of total energy consumption.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
497;International financial flows to developing countries in support of clean and renewable energy reached $18.6 billion in 2016, almost doubling from $9.9 billion in 2010.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
498;From 2000 to 2016, the proportion of the global population with access to electricity increased from 78 per cent to 87 per cent, with the absolute number of people living without electricity dipping to just below 1 billion.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
499;In 2016, 3 billion people (41 per cent of the world’s population) were still cooking with polluting fuel and stove combinations.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
500;Global energy intensity decreased by 2.8 per cent from 2014 to 2015, double the rate of improvement seen between 1990 and 2010.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
501;The share of renewable energy in final energy consumption grew modestly from 2012 to 2014, from 17.9 per cent to 18.3 per cent. Most of the increase was from renewable electricity from water, solar and wind power. Solar and wind power still make up a relatively minor share of energy consumption, despite their rapid growth in recent years. The challenge is to increase the share of renewable energy in the heat and transport sectors, which together account for 80 per cent of global energy consumption.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
502;From 2012 to 2014, three quarters of the world’s 20 largest energy-consuming countries had reduced their energy intensity — the ratio of energy used per unit of GDP. The reduction was driven mainly by greater efficiencies in the industry and transport sectors. However, that progress is still not sufficient to meet the target of doubling the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
503;"The share of renewable energy (derived from hydropower, solid and liquid biofuels, wind, the sun, biogas, geothermal and marine sources, and waste) in the world’s total final energy consumption has increased slowly, from 17.4 per cent in 2000 to 18.1 per cent in 2012. More telling is the fact that modern renewable energy consumption, which excludes solid biofuels used for traditional purposes, grew rapidly, at a rate of 4 per cent a year between 2010 and 2012, and accounted for 60 per cent of all new power-generating capacity in 2014. In absolute terms, about 72 per cent of the increase in energy consumption from modern renewable sources between 2010 and 2012 came from developing regions, mostly from Eastern Asia. The technologies making the largest contribution have been hydropower, wind and solar energy; together they account for 73 per cent of the total increase in modern renewable energy between 2010 and 2012.";;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
504;"In physics, energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on, or to heat, the object.  Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.\nCommon forms of energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object, the potential energy stored by an object's position in a force field (gravitational, electric or magnetic), the elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects, the chemical energy released when a fuel burns, the radiant energy carried by light, and the thermal energy due to an object's temperature.\nMass and energy are closely related. Due to mass–energy equivalence, any object that has mass when stationary (called rest mass) also has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called rest energy, and any additional energy (of any form) acquired by the object above that rest energy will increase the object's total mass just as it increases its total energy. For example, after heating an object, its increase in energy could be measured as a small increase in mass, with a sensitive enough scale.\nLiving organisms require energy to stay alive, such as the energy humans get from food.  Human civilization requires energy to function, which it gets from  energy resources such as fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, or renewable energy. The processes of Earth's climate and ecosystem are driven by the radiant energy Earth receives from the sun and the geothermal energy contained within the earth.";;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
505;Access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy services is highlighted as a global development priority in the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. The adoption of the Plan of Action on Regional Cooperation for Enhanced Energy Security and the Sustainable Use of Energy in Asia and the Pacific 2014-20181 by Ministers attending the Asian and Pacific Energy Forum in May 2013 had earlier confirmed this goal as a priority for the region, underscoring the importance of action by households and Governments and the potential value addition from regional cooperation.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
506;This chapter on energy policy assesses the policy settings, strategies, processes, and institutions in six South East European economies. After a brief overview of energy trends and performance in South East Europe, including the reliability of energy supplies, energy intensity and trends in prices, the chapter then focuses on four essential sub-dimensions. The first, governance and regulation, examines the extent to which overarching energy policy is comprehensive and has clear objectives, and the ability of the national regulatory agency to carry out its critical role. The second sub-dimension, sustainable development, evaluates policies on renewable energy and energy efficiency. The third, energy security, considers policy frameworks for electricity and gas, and emergency and crisis management. Finally the fourth sub-dimension, energy markets, analyses progress towards the formation of a single regional market. The chapter includes suggestions for enhancing the policies in each of these sub-dimensions in order to manage energy well, which in turn would foster the competitiveness of these economies.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
507;"If the world is to develop in line with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, it will be necessary to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy services while reducing greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and the carbon footprint of the energy sector. The Sustainable Development Goal for energy (SDG 7) has three principal objectives: ensure universal access to modern energy services; significantly increase the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix; and double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.";;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
508;"Accelerating energy technology innovation is crucial to meet energy and climate goals, to support economic growth and to enhance energy security. Successful development and deployment of innovative energy technologies requires that stakeholders from both the public and private sector share knowledge, work collaboratively and, where appropriate, pool resources to deliver integrated, cost effective solutions to common challenges.
Four decades ago, the founders of the IEA had the foresight to create a multilateral technology collaboration mechanism – the IEA Implementing Agreements (IAs) – that has withstood the test of time and today is more relevant than ever to delivering solutions to global energy challenges. This network of experts produced a range of noteworthy results, including inventions, pilot plants, demonstration projects, databases and development of standards. The year 2015 marked the 40th anniversary of the mechanism as well as the rebranding of the IAs as Technology Collaboration Programmes (TCPs).
This publication provides an overview of the activities and recent accomplishments of TCPs. The 39 TCPs operating today involve about 6 000 experts from government, industry and research organisations in 51 countries around the world. Participants in TCPs have examined more than 1 900 energy-related topics in the areas of energy efficiency, renewable energy, fossil fuels, fusion power and cross-cutting issues.
The unrivalled breadth and coverage of analytical expertise seen in TCPs are unique assets that will underpin for the years to come IEA efforts to support innovation for energy security, economic growth and environmental protection.";;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
509;The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development encompasses a vision for a future which is safe, resilient, and sustainable. The 2030 Agenda comprises 17 SDGs, which are integrated and indivisible. SDG 7 aims to “ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all,” and has targets to ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix, and double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency, all by 2030. SDG 7 presents interlinkages with the other 16 SDGs. Lack of progress in one sector may hinder the development and growth of other sectors. Therefore, a coordinated and integrated approach to energy transition needs to address social, economic, and environmental dimensions during implementation of SDG 7.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
510;This chapter assesses the investment framework for green growth in Viet Nam. It looks at challenges and opportunities for sustainable economic growth and provides an assessment of the regulatory framework for green investment, focusing notably on environmental protection, climate change, renewable energy and energy efficiency. It also reviews the institutional capacity to design and implement green growth policies as well as financial policies and instruments for green growth and investment.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
511;The energy transition will require a major transformation of the current policy frameworks. It should start with the alignment of energy policies with the targets of the 2030 Agenda, followed by prioritizing technologies to deliver the energy transition in a cost-effective manner. Without creating an enabling investment climate to stimulate private investment, the energy transition will be impossible, particularly with regard to financing the growth of renewable energy and energy efficiency. Long-term energy procurement policies, fiscal incentives such as a corporate tax holiday, and enabling easy access to finance have the potential to derisk capital investment and increase private sector participation. Phasing out fossil fuel subsidy deserves urgent consideration in order to discourage wastage of energy, prevent draining of fiscal resources, and improve the cost-effectiveness of renewable energy and energy efficient technologies. Market instruments, such as a price on carbon or a levy on fossil fuel, are instrumental in generating funds to cover the cost of damage by fossil fuel combustion as well as level the playing field for renewable energy. Finally, regional cooperation is essential to combating some of the crucial policy and technological challenges, such as allowing a higher share of variable renewable energy penetration in the grid by expanding the coverage of an interconnected network;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
512;This chapter reviews the challenges in Ukraine confronting the shift to sustainable energy, and the emerging policy context for green investment. It discusses both supply-side policy measures related to renewable energy and power sector efficiency as well as demand-side policies on energy efficiency. The chapter also analyses climate change policies as a driver of energy sector improvements. The chapter finishes with a discussion of the most recent policy developments with a particular focus on the new Energy Strategy to 2035.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
513;This publication provides governments with guidance on the policy options that are available to make the most of private investment opportunities in clean energy infrastructure, drawing on the expertise of climate and investment communities among others. It identifies key issues for policy makers to consider, including in investment policy, investment promotion and facilitation, competition policy, financial markets, and public governance. It also addresses cross-cutting issues, including regional co-operation and international trade for investment in clean energy infrastructure.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
514;Energy is widely recognised as the engine for economic growth and modern life. The way we live, construct, produce, eat and commute has a major bearing on energy, most of which is derived from coal, oil and natural gas. Fossil fuels are being consumed at a much faster rate than they can be replenished. If we continue to demand fossil fuels at 2006 rates, the reserves of oil, coal and gas will last a further 40, 200 and 70 years, respectively.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
515;The European Union is committed to a sustainable, competitive, secure and decarbonised energy system. The Energy Union and the Energy and Climate Policy Framework for 2030 establish ambitious Union commitments to reduce greenhouse gas emissions further (by at least 40% by 2030, as compared with 1990), to increase the proportion of renewable energy consumed (by at least 27%) and to make energy savings of 30% at the Union level by 2030.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
516;"Energy is essential for humanity to develop and thrive. In 2015, the new Sustainable Development Goals, adopted by 193 countries, included for the first time a target to ensure affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all, underscoring a new level of political agreement on the importance of access to modern energy services. At the same time, the declining cost of decentralised renewables, increased access to affordable energyefficient appliances and the use of mobile platforms are changing the way we think about providing energy access. It is against this backdrop that the IEA produced this Special Report, part of its flagship World Energy Outlook (WEO) series.
This report:
Expands and updates the WEO’s country-by-country electricity and clean cooking access database, and assesses the status for all developing countries, reviewing recent trends and policy efforts up to 2016.
Presents a global and regional electricity and clean cooking access outlook to 2030, with a dedicated chapter on sub-Saharan Africa.
Provides a pathway for achieving access to modern energy for all by 2030, identifying policy priorities, detailing investment needs, and the role that decentralised and on-grid solutions may play.
Analyses how energy development can unleash economic growth in sectors such as agriculture, and explores how energy access intersects with other issues such as gender, health and climate change.";;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
517;The energy resources of Tajikistan are represented by natural gas, petroleum products and very significant resources of hydropower. The country is also endowed with substantial coal resources, but exploration of coalfields is not organized on an industrial scale, due to their location in mountainous remote places. The national economy depends on imports for the bulk of its primary energy requirements, due to the low level of mining and processing of gas and oil resources. It is not foreseen that other non-conventional sources of energy, such as wind, solar and geothermal power, will significantly contribute to the energy balance in the future. The energy system in Tajikistan consists of six large hydropower plants (HPPs), several thermal power plants (TPPs), and many small, mini- and micro-HPPs.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
518;This chapter identifies, documents and provides estimates of the various subsidies in Moldova that relate to the production or use of coal, oil and related petroleum products, natural gas, and electricity and heat generated on the basis of these fossil fuels. The chapter also briefly looks at the subsidies benefiting energyefficiency measures and renewable energy sources. An overview of the country's energy sector is first given to place the measures listed into context. In addition, the chapter discusses pricing and tax policies in the energy sector in Moldova. The analysis summarises the context, the state of play, and the mechanics of the complex and evolving landscape of energy subsidies in the country.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
519;"improving energy efficiency has long been advocated as a way to increase the productivity and sustainability of society, primarily through the delivery of energy savings. The impact of energy efficiency measures can go far beyond energy savings, and energy efficiency improvements can be an important contributor to economic growth and social development.
Benefits attributed to the implementation of energy efficiency measures range from localised benefits, such as energy affordability, improved health, wellbeing and social development, to sectoral benefits, such as industrial productivity, improved asset values and reduced environmental damage. Macroeconomic outcomes such as national competitiveness, jobs, consumer surplus and energy security, as well as poverty alleviation and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation in both developed and developing countries, are further associated with energy efficiency measures. Significant evidence is emerging on the extent to which these outcomes stem from energy efficiency policies. At the same time, evaluation experts are beginning to explore ways to quantify them so that they can be more readily assessed alongside energy savings. Expanding evaluation to such matters could offer a new perspective on energy efficiency measures and, by improving the cost/benefit assessment of energy efficiency programs, could help decision-makers reconcile perceived trade-offs between supporting economic growth and reducing energy use.
This paper makes a preliminary assessment of the scope of the most significant of the multiple benefits and discusses the potentially large implications for energy efficiency policy as part of a wider socioeconomic strategy.";;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
520;Despite growing energy use, for the first time in four decades, global carbon emissions associated with energy consumption remained stable in 2014 as the global economy grew. This stabilization has in part been attributed to increased penetration of renewable energy and to improvements in energy efficiency, both of which have experienced dramatic acceleration in recent years.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
521;Research from the Global Subsidies Initiative (GSI), of the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) supported by the Nordic Council of Ministers (NCM), finds that, on average, across 20 countries the phased removal of fossil fuel subsidies between now and 2020 could lead to average national emissions reductions of 10.92% as against a business-as-usual (BAU) baseline. Emissions reductions would be increased to 18.15% if a small amount of the savings from subsidy reform (30%) are redirected toward renewables and energy efficiency. The cumulative savings from across the 20 countries by 2020 amounts to 2.8 gigatonnes (Gt) of CO2e. Furthermore, because this is a policy tool that saves government resources, it is estimated that for every tonne of CO2e removed through FFSR governments save an average of USD 92.83.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
522;There is a strong and growing focus on the implementation of renewable energy and energy storage technologies. The Nordic countries have a strong position in Renewable Energy (RE) solutions such as wind, water and bioenergy/fuel due to a wellfunctioning energy market and inter-governmental cooperation.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
523;"The main energy sources in Georgia are natural gas, petroleum products, hydropower and biomass. Hydropower dominates Georgia’s electricity generation sector, while the national economy depends on imports for the bulk of its primary energy requirements due to the low level of domestic oil and gas resources and there being only a few coal deposits in the country. The national energy sector is composed of the natural gas transportation and distribution sectors, power generation plants, the Georgian State Electrosystem (GSE), up to 34 natural gas distribution companies and three large power distribution companies. More than 70 per cent of primary energy supply is imported; fossil fuels make up more than 70 per cent of this.";;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;

526;"Ensuring energy security and addressing climate change cost-effectively are key global challenges. Tackling these issues will require efforts from stakeholders worldwide. To find solutions, the public and private sectors must work together, sharing burdens and resources, while at the same time multiplying results and outcomes.
Through its broad range of multilateral technology initiatives (Implementing Agreements), the IEA enables member and non-member countries, businesses, industries, international organisations and non-governmental organisations to share research on breakthrough technologies, to fill existing research gaps, to build pilot plants and to carry out deployment or demonstration programmes across the energy sector. In short, their work can comprise any technology-related activity that supports energy security, economic growth, environmental protection and engagement worldwide.
Some 40 Implementing Agreements carry out programmes in the areas of energy efficiency (buildings, electricity, industry, and transport), fossil fuels (clean coal, enhanced oil recovery, carbon capture and storage), fusion power (tokamaks, materials, technologies, safety, alternate concepts) and renewable energy technologies, and cross-cutting topics (technology transfer, research databases, and modeling).
This publication highlights the most significant recent achievements of the IEA Implementing Agreements. The core of the IEA Energy Technology Network, these initiatives are a fundamental building block for facilitating the entry of new and improved energy technologies into the marketplace.";;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
527;"Wind and solar photovoltaics (PV) are currently the fastest-growing sources of electricity globally. A ""next generation"" phase of deployment is emerging, in which wind and solar PV are technologically mature and economically affordable.
The success of variable renewable energy (VRE) is also bringing new challenges to the fore. Electricity generation from both technologies is constrained by the varying availability of wind and sunshine. This can make it difficult to maintain the necessary balance between electricity supply and consumption at all times.
As these variable renewables enter this next generation of deployment, the issue of system and market integration becomes a critical priority for renewables policy and energy policy more broadly. The paper highlights that this will require strategic action in three areas:
- System-friendly deployment, aiming to maximise the net benefit of wind and solar power for the entire system
- Improved operating strategies, such as advanced renewable energy forecasting and enhanced scheduling of power plants
- Investment in additional flexible resources, comprising demand-side resources, electricity storage, grid infrastructure and flexible generation";;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
528;Page 1 of 11 2018 HLPF Review of SDG implementation: SDG 7- Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all Status of Progress on SDG 7 Energy lies at the heart of both the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the Paris Agreement on Climate Change. Ensuring access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by 2030 will open a new world of opportunities for billions of people through new economic opportunities and jobs, empowered women, children and youth, better education and health, more sustainable, equitable and inclusive communities, and greater protections from, and resilience to, climate change. Urgent action is needed, however, to leave no one behind and to achieve Sustainable Development Goal 7 (SDG7) and consequently other SDGs: • 1 billion people currently live without electricity.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
529;From 2000 to 2016, the proportion of the global population with access to electricity increased from 78 per cent to 87 per cent, with the number of people living without access to electricity dipping to just about 1 billion. If the current trends continue, there would still be 674 million people living without access to electricity in 2030. To reach universal access by 2030, the rate of access to electricity needs to improve 0.8 per cent every year. • 3 billion people continue to lack access to clean cooking solutions. Access to clean fuels and technologies for cooking has gradually improved to reach 59 per cent globally in 2016, up 10 percentage points since 2000. Even with this progress, however, almost 3 billion people are still cooking with polluting fuel and stove combinations. To reach universal access to clean cooking by 2030, the annual rate of clean cooking access needs to accelerate to 3 percent.;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;
530;If the current trajectory continues, 2.3 billion of the global population would remain without access to clean cooking in 2030. • Modern renewable power generation is expanding rapidly, but much greater efforts will be required in end-uses. Rapidly falling costs and policy support have made solar and wind cost-competitive with conventional power generation Page 2 of 11 sources in many places, making them account for over 50 per cent of annual global power capacity additions in recent years. However, total global renewable energy consumption increased only marginally to 17.5 per cent in 2015, from 17.3 per cent in 2014, reflecting lack of progress in use of renewables for transport and heating/cooling. • The global rate of improvement in energy efficiency has been accelerating recently. During the period 2014-15, global primary energy intensity fell by 2.8 per cent, the fastest decline since 2010. However, energy intensity needs to improve at an annual rate of 2.7 per cent over the period 2016-2030, c;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;;

Overall average annual GDP growth in the least developed countries followed a similar trend, decelerating from 7.1 per cent in 2005 -2009 to 4.9 per cent in 2010-2015, below the Sustainable Development Goals target of 7 per cent.;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
569;An economic system, or economic order, is a system of production, resource allocation and distribution of goods and services within a society or a given geographic area. It includes the combination of the various institutions, agencies, entities, decision-making processes and patterns of consumption that comprise the economic structure of a given community. As such, an economic system is a type of social system. The mode of production is a related concept. All economic systems have three basic questions to ask: what to produce, how to produce and in what quantities, and who receives the output of production.\nThe study of economic systems includes how these various agencies and institutions are linked to one another, how information flows between them and the social relations within the system (including property rights and the structure of management). The analysis of economic systems traditionally focused on the dichotomies and comparisons between market economies and planned economies and on the distinctions between capitalism and socialism. Subsequently, the categorization of economic systems expanded to include other topics and models that do not conform to the traditional dichotomy. Today the dominant form of economic organization at the world level is based on market-oriented mixed economies.;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
570;"An economy (from Greek οίκος – ""household"" and νέμoμαι – ""manage"") is an area of the production, distribution and trade, as well as consumption of goods and services by different agents. Understood in its broadest sense, \'The economy is defined as a social domain that emphasize the practices, discourses, and material expressions associated with the production, use, and management of resources\'. A given economy is the result of a set of processes that involves its culture, values, education, technological evolution, history, social organization, political structure and legal systems, as well as its geography, natural resource endowment, and ecology, as main factors. These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions. In other words, the economic domain is a social domain of human practices and transactions. It does not stand alone.\nEconomic agents can be individuals, businesses, organizations, or governments. Economic transactions occur when two groups or parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency. However, monetary transactions only account for a small part of the economic domain. \nEconomic activity is spurred by production which uses natural resources, labor and capital";;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
571;"Saving is income not spent, or deferred consumption. Methods of saving include putting money aside in, for example, a deposit account, a pension account, an investment fund, or as cash. Saving also involves reducing expenditures, such as recurring costs. In terms of personal finance, saving generally specifies low-risk preservation of money, as in a deposit account, versus investment, wherein risk is a lot higher; in economics more broadly, it refers to any income not used for immediate consumption. Saving does not automatically include interest. \nSaving differs from savings. The former refers to the act of not consuming one\'s assets, whereas the latter refers to either multiple opportunities to reduce costs; or one\'s assets in the form of cash. Saving refers to an activity occurring over time, a flow variable, whereas savings refers to something that exists at any one time, a stock variable. This distinction is often misunderstood, and even professional economists and investment professionals will often refer to ""saving"" as ""savings"".In different contexts there can be subtle differences in what counts as saving. For example, the part of a person\'s income that is spent on mortgage loan principal repayments is not spent on present consumption and is therefore saving by the above definition, even though people do not always think of repaying a loan as saving. However, in the U.S. measurement of the numbers behind its gross national product (i.e., the National Income and Product Accounts), personal interest payments are not treated as ""saving"" unless the institutions and people who receive them save them.\nSaving is closely related to physical investment, in that the former provides a source of funds for the latter.";;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
572;By not using income to buy consumer goods and services, it is possible for resources to instead be invested by being used to produce fixed capital, such as factories and machinery. Saving can therefore be vital to increase the amount of fixed capital available, which contributes to economic growth.\nHowever, increased saving does not always correspond to increased investment. If savings are not deposited into a financial intermediary such as a bank, there is no chance for those savings to be recycled as investment by business. This means that saving may increase without increasing investment, possibly causing a short-fall of demand (a pile-up of inventories, a cut-back of production, employment, and income, and thus a recession) rather than to economic growth. In the short term, if saving falls below investment, it can lead to a growth of aggregate demand and an economic boom. In the long term if saving falls below investment it eventually reduces investment and detracts from future growth. Future growth is made possible by foregoing present consumption to increase investment. However savings not deposited into a financial intermediary amount to an (interest-free) loan to the government or central bank, who can recycle this loan.\nIn a primitive agricultural economy savings might take the form of holding back the best of the corn harvest as seed corn for the next planting season. If the whole crop were consumed the economy would convert to hunting and gathering the next season.;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
573;Employment is a relationship between two parties, usually based on contract where work is paid for, where one party, which may be a corporation, for profit, not-for-profit organization, co-operative or other entity is the employer and the other is the employee. Employees work in return for payment, which may be in the form of an hourly wage, by piecework or an annual salary, depending on the type of work an employee does or which sector they are working in. Employees in some fields or sectors may receive gratuities, bonus payment or stock options. In some types of employment, employees may receive benefits in addition to payment. Benefits can include health insurance, housing, disability insurance or use of a gym. Employment is typically governed by employment laws, organisation or legal contracts.;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
574;"A workplace is a location where someone works for his or her employer, a place of employment. Such a place can range from a home office to a large office building or factory. For industrialized societies, the workplace is one of the most important social spaces other than the home, constituting ""a central concept for several entities: the worker and his/her family, the employing organization, the customers of the organization, and the society as a whole"". The development of new communication technologies have led to the development of the virtual workplace, a workplace that is not located in any one physical space.";;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
575;Sustained and inclusive economic growth is necessary for achieving sustainable development. The global annual growth rate of real GDP per capita increased by 1.3 per cent in 2014, a significant slowdown compared to 2010 (2.8 per cent growth) and 2000 (3.0 per cent growth). Developing regions grew far faster than developed regions, with average annual growth rates in 2014 of 3.1 per cent and 1.4 per cent, respectively.;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
576;"Sustained and inclusive economic growth can drive progress, create decent jobs for all and improve living standards. Globally, real GDP per capita and labour productivity have increased, and unemployment has dropped back to pre-financial-crisis levels. However, sluggish growth overall has prompted a rethinking of economic and social policies to achieve the transformational objectives of Goal 8 so as to meet economic growth targets in least developed countries; increase employment opportunities, especially for young people; reduce inequalities across regions, age groups and genders; decrease informal employment; and promote safe and secure working environments for all workers.";;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
577;YOUTH employment and economic empowerment are essential components of a strong foundation in any society. Having decent work is crucial for young people and their future, but it also has a domino effect on local communities, countries and the world as a whole. The present challenge lies in simultaneously creating jobs for the bulging youth population and addressing related concerns such as the skills mismatch, working poverty, and the suboptimal school-to-work transition situation, especially in the developing world. Disadvantaged youth often benefit most from the creation of new opportunities, skills training, microcredit provision, support for small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), and investments in education, all of which contribute to providing the knowledge and tools needed to be competitive in the international labour market.;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
578;"Sustainable Development Goal 8 is focused on economic growth, and decent employment and working conditions. As such, the targets in place to monitor the progress made in these areas cover the following: GDP growth with a focus on least developed countries; diversification; creation of decent jobs; resource efficiency; decent work for all with a focus on youth employment; eradication of child and forced labour; safe working environments; sustainable tourism; and access to financial support.";;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
579;Sustained and inclusive economic growth drives development by providing more resources for education, health, personal consumption, and transport, water and energy infrastructure. Economic growth can also lead to new and better employment opportunities. Sustaining high real economic growth is not easy, however, and only a few of the least developed countries have consistently closed in on the 7 per cent average annual growth target for real GDP. Moreover, economic growth is not necessarily sustainable when countries are depleting their natural resources for the sake of economic growth and thus shifting the burden of environmental degradation and damage to future generations.;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
580;Sustained and inclusive economic growth is a prerequisite for sustainable development, which can contribute to improved livelihoods for people around the world. Economic growth can lead to new and better employment opportunities and provide greater economic security for all. Moreover, rapid growth, especially among the least developed and developing countries, can help them reduce the wage gap relative to developed countries, thereby diminishing glaring inequalities between the rich and poor.;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
581;The region’s average urban unemployment rate held steady at 9.3% in 2018 after increasing by 2.4 percentage points between 2014 and 2017. In the same period, the regional urban employment rate is estimated to have risen slightly (by 0.1 percentage points) for the first time since 2013. Even so, the 2018 rate was still 1.3 percentage points below its 2013 level. This rise in the employment-to-population ratio was not enough to reduce the urban unemployment rate because more people entered the labour market in search of work. On a year-on-year comparison, this increase was reflected in what was likewise a small rise in the participation rate, a trend that began in 2015.;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
582;The Millennium Development Goal (MDG) target of halving the proportion of people living in extreme poverty was met five years ahead of schedule. Overall, the number of people living on less than US$1.25 per day fell from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 836 million in 2015 . While SDGs 1 and 10 represent a continued focus on poverty and all aspects of inequality, SDG 8 gives broader attention to ‘sustained, inclusive and sustainable growth’ as a foundation for prosperity and sustainable development more generally.;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
583;Northern Ireland has made significant strides to improve the overall engagement of employers with the skills system. The Success through Skills and Securing Our Success strategies implemented new initiatives to ‘put employers in the driving seat’. Achieving such ambitious objectives requires a responsive education and training system that prepares the workforce for the skills needed in today and tomorrow’s labour market. Automation and digitalisation will continue to alter the labour market in Northern Ireland, requiring new and innovative approaches to training targeted to both youth entering the labour market as well as existing workers in at risk jobs.;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;

585;Labour market composition and trends are important determinants of macroeconomic performance.

Portugal’s export performance over the past decade has been impressive, helping to reduce external imbalances. This partly owed to a sequence of structural reforms that benefited the productivity of the export sector and led to an increase in its size. Nonetheless, exports as a share of GDP and the stock of foreign direct investment remain below that of other comparable small European economies. Further shifting the orientation of the economy to the external sector is vital for Portugal given the strong link between trade openness and GDP per capita. To do this, policymakers must ensure that policy settings incentivise exporting firms to expand and improve their competitiveness, both through lower price and improved quality. For example, regulatory barriers that reduce competition in professional services should be lowered to improve the price and quality of intermediate inputs. Increasing the efficiency of domestic infrastructure is also key, especially through competition-enhancing reforms to the port sector. To further differentiate and improve Portuguese export products, skills in the business sector need to be enhanced through better-targeted lifelong learning opportunities. At the same time, there is a need to focus innovation policies on raising the participation of small and medium enterprises in innovative activities.";;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
587;YOUNG people face numerous challenges affecting their development and well-being. Among the greatest of these challenges are unemployment and the lack of decent work for youth, which many countries have struggled unsuccessfully to address. Similarly, despite the progress made in raising basic literacy rates, many countries have been unable to provide their youth populations with quality education and the skills they need for the world of work. As the global youth population continues to increase, greater investment is needed to enhance young people’s education and employment opportunities in order to leverage their human capital. Without such investment, quality education (Goal 4) and decent work (Goal 8) will remain out of reach for youth in many countries.;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
588;"Chapter 3 is concerned with inclusive societies in developing and emerging economies. Rapid demographic transitions, urbanisation, jobless growth and premature deindustrialisation are placing huge pressure on the development of cohesive societies. Citizens of developing countries, and particularly young people, are growing increasingly disaffected as inequality rises, and un- and underemployment grow. René N’Guettia Kouassi’s piece focuses on the problem of growing inequality across the world. Gilbert Houngbo discusses the rise of young people in informal employment globally and potential policy solutions to this problem. Samir Saran and Vivan Sharan also tackle informality but from the perspective of India; they argue that technology could play a role in ameliorating it. Finally, Hussein Al-Majali analyses the lack of opportunities for youth in the MENA region and how political leaders there need to build a new conception of “active citizenship.";;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
589;This chapter reviews policies to strengthen Germany’s productivity growth and prepare for changes in labour markets brought about by new technologies. The chapter also discusses how social protection and the bargaining framework should be reformed for the future of work. Germany enjoys a relatively high labour productivity level but productivity growth has been modest in recent years. There is room to boost productivity growth by accelerating the diffusion of new technologies throughout the economy. Vigorous entrepreneurship and innovation by small and medium enterprises are key for such technology diffusion while strong broadband and mobile networks widen the scope of data-intensive technologies that can be exploited to increase productivity. Widespread use of new technologies will bring about significant changes in skill demand and work arrangements. As in many countries, Germany saw a decline in the share of middle-skilled jobs in employment. A relatively high share of jobs is expected to be automated or undergo significant changes in task contents as a result of technological change. New technologies are also likely to increase individuals engaging in new forms of work, such as gig work intermediated by digital platforms. Such workers are less covered by public social safety nets such as unemployment insurance than regular employment.;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
590;This chapter on employment assesses the policy settings, strategies, processes and institutions in six South East European economies. After a brief overview of employment trends and performance in South East Europe, the chapter then focuses on four essential sub-dimensions. The first sub-dimension, labour market governance, analyses the capacity of key labour market institutions and strategies to ensure high-quality jobs and develop flexible, inclusive and proactive labour markets. The second, activation policy, assesses activation measures and institutions and their ability to bring jobseekers and disadvantaged groups into the labour force and into jobs. The third, job quality, analyses policy measures that contribute to the well-being of workers by looking at earnings quality, labour market security and quality of the working environment. The final sub-dimension, social economy, explores government efforts to promote the social economy and an environment conducive to social enterprises. The chapter includes suggestions for enhancing the policies in each of these sub-dimensions in order to improve employment policy, which in turn would foster the competitiveness of these economies.;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
591;"When migrants are asked about their reasons for coming to Europe, the ‘search for a better life’ is a frequent response, and this motivation often includes the hope of finding better job opportunities than in the country of origin (Djaha, 2013; Jawad et al., 2016). Nonetheless, when they arrive and settle in Europe, migrants face obstacles to entering the labour market. Existing research shows that foreign-born persons are more likely to be unemployed, and, when in employment, are more likely to work in short-term or part-time positions than native-born persons (Arbetsmarknadsekonomiska rådet, 2017). With length of stay in the host country, employment gaps narrow but do not fully disappear (Karlsdóttir et al., 2017). This chapter will highlight current employment gaps across the Nordic Region between native and foreign-born persons. It will also highlight differences in employment rates within the diverse group of foreign-born migrants.";;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
592;Against a backdrop of the widening income distribution in most countries, OECD governments need to formulate policies that support sustainable and inclusive economic growth. Tax policies play a crucial role in this endeavour. Both tax theory and mounting empirical evidence suggest that many countries could achieve both higher and more broadly shared income growth. Many countries, however, seem hesitant to fundamentally restructure their tax systems to achieve higher and more inclusive growth. This reluctance begs a key question: Why forego tax policy reforms that hold the obvious promise of win-win outcomes of both higher and more inclusive growth? To offer some concrete answers to this question, this paper reports the findings of a synthesis of cross-country empirical work on the ranking (in terms of efficiency and distributional impact) of major tax instruments on the one hand, and, on the other, country-specific tax policy assessments reported in several dozen OECD Economic Surveys since 2008. The paper identifies a wide range of factors, some common to many countries and some country-specific, that prevent governments from adopting tax structures more favourable to inclusive growth. These include political economy forces, legal obstacles, administrative constraints, and intergovernmental fiscal arrangements.;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
593;"Historically low productivity gains and record high inequality are major challenges for policy makers around the world. Both concerns have been exacerbated by the global financial crisis but took roots well before and reflect fundamental challenges with the way our economies function.
This report proposes a new comprehensive approach to promote better productivity performance and reduce inequalities. It not only gathers the most recent empirical evidence on the main factors behind slowing productivity gains and rising or persisting inequalities but also suggests possible common foundations and linkages between these two trends. It stresses the risk of a vicious cycle setting in, where individuals with fewer skills and poorer access to opportunities are confined to unproductive and often precarious jobs. This reduces aggregate productivity and widens inequality. The report focuses on how to expand the productive assets of an economy by investing in the skills of its people and providing an environment where all firms have a fair chance to succeed, including in lagging regions. It draws preliminary conclusions on the type of policy packages that are needed and on their implications for policy making. It also sets an agenda for future research to deepen empirical evidence and make concrete country-specific policy recommendations.";;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
594;"Work can eliminate well-being deprivations by expanding one’s capabilities and opportunities. The provision of work opportunities among youth is not only an instrument for achieving the greater good of society and greater freedom for individuals to expand their opportunities; it is also a means to realize the demographic dividend in Timor-Leste.";;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
595;The US labour market has been exposed to repeated disruptions in the past two decades, and a wave of change stemming from the rise of automation is looming large. Although unemployment is at an historical low, many displaced workers remain inactive and wages have been stagnant for occupation affected by these disruptions. The upcoming automation of tasks with robots, artificial intelligence and machine learning will bring many benefits, but it will also lead to employment losses and wage pressures for workers whose tasks will be automated. While the US labour market had traditionally the capacity to absorb these shocks, labour market fluidity has slowed in the past two decades, hindering the reallocation of labour and contributing to high unemployment and weak participation, with some locations particularly affected by these social troubles. Lessons from these past trends are helpful to formulate future policies helping improving opportunities for displaced workers.;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
596;The world of work and labour markets are transforming. This chapter provides estimates of the shares of jobs that are likely to be automated or face significant change, and presents evidence and insights on job creation across sectors, labour market dynamics, key fields of studies for a digital world, training of workers by skill level, and active labour market expenditures. It discusses how policy can help prepare workers for many new jobs and changes to existing ones, and how to empower people with the mix of skills needed to succeed in a digital world of work. This chapter also underscores the importance of getting ready for a massive training challenge, as well as the need to review education systems, improve social protection to ensure no one is left behind, and address concerns about emerging forms of work.;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;
597;Immigrants’ skills and how they integrate into the labour market are fundamental to becoming part of the host country’s economic fabric. Although skills and qualifications are obviously decisive determinants in immigrants’ economic and social integration, they do not necessarily indicate how well immigrants actually integrate or fare in the labour market, but rather their ability to do so. Skills have indeed a strong bearing on career paths, and influence what kind of job they find.Employment is often considered to be the single most important indicator of integration. Jobs are immigrants’ chief source of income and also help them – though there is no guarantee – to take their place in society by, for example, finding decent accommodation, interacting with others in the workplace, and learning the host-country language. Work further confers social standing in the eyes of the immigrant’s family, particularly children, and with respect to the host-country population. However, while employment is important per se, so is its quality. This chapter begins by considering immigrants’ skills. It compares their levels of educational attainment with those of the native-born (Indicator ), assesses their proficiency in the host-country language (Indicator ) and their access to adult education and training (Indicator ). It then examines immigrants’ labour market outcomes, analysing their employment, participation and unemployment rates (Indicators  and ) and looking at indicators on labour market exclusion – long-term unemployment and involuntary inactivity (Indicator ). The chapter goes on to look at the characteristics of the jobs that immigrants hold: types of contracts (Indicator ), working conditions (Indicator ) and the skill levels of jobs (Indicator ). It also considers the match between workers’ educational attainment and the requirements of their occupations (Indicator ). The chapter concludes with a look at the incidence of self-employment (Indicator ).;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;;

626;Efficient transportation services are key drivers of economic development, and more than 80 per cent of world merchandise trade by volume is transported by sea, making maritime transport a critical enabler of trade and globalization. International maritime freight increased by an estimated 3.7 per cent globally in 2017 and projected growth will test the capacity of existing maritime transport infrastructure to support increased freight volumes.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
627;In 2018, global manufacturing slowed in both developing and developed regions. The slowdown was attributed mainly to emerging trade and tariff barriers that constrained investment and future growth. Despite this slowdown, the global share of GDP in terms of manufacturing value added increased marginally from 15.9 per cent in 2008 to 16.5 per cent in 2015, but stalled at the same level in 2018. The share of manufacturing in least developed countries remained low, posing a serious challenge to the target of doubling the industry’s share of GDP by 2030.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;

In 2015, the estimated global economic impact (both direct and indirect) of air transport was $2.7 trillion, equivalent to 3.5 per cent of global GDP. The least developed countries, landlocked developing countries and small island developing States represent far less air travel and freight volumes, with each country group accounting for only 1 per cent to 2.7 per cent of the global total.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
636;An industry is a sector that produces goods or related services within an economy. The major source of revenue of a group or company is an indicator of what industry it should be classified in.  When a large corporate group has multiple sources of revenue generation, it is considered to be working in different industries. The manufacturing industry became a key sector of production and labour in European and North American countries during the Industrial Revolution, upsetting previous mercantile and feudal economies. This came through many successive rapid advances in technology, such as the development of steam power and the production of steel and coal.\nFollowing the Industrial Revolution, possibly a third of the economic output came from manufacturing industries. Many developed countries and many developing/semi-developed countries (China, India etc.) depend significantly on manufacturing industry.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
637;Manufacturing is the production of products for use or sale using labor and machines, tools, chemical or biological processing or formulation, and is the essence of secondary industry. The term may refer to a range of human activity from handicraft to high tech but is most commonly applied to industrial design, in which raw materials from primary industry are transformed into finished goods on a large scale. Such finished goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other more complex products (such as aircraft, household appliances, furniture, sports equipment or automobiles), or distributed via the tertiary industry to end users and consumers (usually through wholesalers, who in turn sell to retailers, who then sell them to individual customers).\nManufacturing engineering or manufacturing process are the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product. The manufacturing process begins with the product design, and materials specification from which the product is made. These materials are then modified through manufacturing processes to become the required part.\nModern manufacturing includes all intermediate processes required in the production and integration of a product's components. Some industries, such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers use the term fabrication instead.\nThe manufacturing sector is closely connected with engineering and industrial design. Examples of major manufacturers in North America include General Motors Corporation, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, General Dynamics, Boeing, Pfizer Precision Castparts And FCA. Examples in Europe include Volkswagen Group, Siemens, FCA  and Michelin. Examples in Asia include Toyota, Yamaha, Panasonic, LG, Samsung and Tata Motors.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
638;An invention is a unique or novel device, method, composition or process. The invention process is a process within an overall engineering and product development process. It may be an improvement upon a machine or product or a new process for creating an object or a result. An invention that achieves a completely unique function or result may be a radical breakthrough. Such works are novel and not obvious to others skilled in the same field. An inventor may be taking a big step toward success or failure.\nSome inventions can be patented. A patent legally protects the intellectual property rights of the inventor and legally recognizes that a claimed invention is actually an invention. The rules and requirements for patenting an invention vary by country and the process of obtaining a patent is often expensive.\nAnother meaning of invention is cultural invention, which is an innovative set of useful social behaviours adopted by people and passed on to others. The Institute for Social Inventions collected many such ideas in magazines and books. Invention is also an important component of artistic and design creativity. Inventions often extend the boundaries of human knowledge, experience or capability.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
639;"Innovation in its modern meaning is ""a new idea, creative thoughts, new imaginations in form of device or method"". Innovation is often also viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. Such innovation takes place through the provision of more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are made available to markets, governments and society. An innovation is something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that ""breaks into"" the market or society. Innovation is related to, but not the same as, invention, as innovation is more apt to involve the practical implementation of an invention (ie new / improved ability) to make a meaningful impact in the market or society, and not all innovations require an invention. Innovation often manifests itself via the engineering process, when the problem being solved is of a technical or scientific nature. The opposite of innovation is exnovation.\nWhile a novel device is often described as an innovation, in economics, management science, and other fields of practice and analysis, innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in such a way that they affect society. In industrial economics, innovations are created and found empirically from services to meet growing consumer demand.Innovation also has an older historical meaning which is quite different.  From the 1400s through the 1600s, prior to early American settlement, the concept of ""innovation"" was pejorative. It was an early modern synonym for rebellion, revolt and heresy.";;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
640;"Infrastructure is the fundamental facilities and systems serving a country, city, or other area, including the services and facilities necessary for its economy to function. Infrastructure is composed of public and private physical improvements such as roads, railways, bridges, tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids, and telecommunications (including Internet connectivity and broadband speeds). In general, it has also been defined as ""the physical components of interrelated systems providing commodities and services essential to enable, sustain, or enhance societal living conditions"".\n\nThere are two general types of ways to view infrastructure, hard or soft. Hard infrastructure refers to the physical networks necessary for the functioning of a modern industry. This includes roads, bridges, railways, etc. Soft infrastructure refers to all the institutions that maintain the economic, health, social, and cultural standards of a country. This includes educational programs, official statistics, parks and recreational facilities, law enforcement agencies, and emergency services.\nThe word infrastructure has been used in French since 1875 and in English since 1887, originally meaning ""The installations that form the basis for any operation or system"". The word was imported from French, where it was already used for establishing a roadbed of substrate material, required before railroad tracks or constructed pavement could be laid on top of it. The word is a combination of the Latin prefix ""infra"", meaning ""below"" as many of these constructions are underground, for example, tunnels, water and gas systems, and railways and the French word ""structure"" (derived from the Latin word ""structure""). The army use of the term achieved currency in the United States after the formation of NATO in the 1940s, and by 1970 was adopted by urban planners in its modern civilian sense.";;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
641;"Sustainable Development Goal 9 addresses three important aspects of sustainable development: infrastructure, industrialization and innovation. Infrastructure provides the basic physical facilities essential to business and society; industrialization drives economic growth and job creation, thereby reducing income inequality; and innovation expands the technological capabilities of industrial sectors and leads to the development of new skills.";;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
642;"Sustainable Development Goal 9, to build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation, addresses three important aspects of sustainable development: infrastructure, industrialization and innovation. Infrastructure provides the basic physical facilities essential to business and societal development; industrialization drives economic growth and decent job creation, thereby reducing income poverty; and innovation expands the technological capabilities of industrial sectors and leads to the development of new skills. The Goal is aimed at consolidating national and international efforts towards promoting infrastructure development, industrialization and innovation. Achieving this requires increased domestic and international financial mobilization, technological and technical support, research and innovation, and increased access to information and communication technology. Goal 9 is one of the most critical Goals in support of Africa’s aspiration for rapid development and transformation through increased productive capacities. Achieving the Goal will have positive multiplier effects for all other Goals.";;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
643;Inclusive and sustainable industrialization, together with innovation and infrastructure, can unleash dynamic and competitive economic forces that generate employment and income. They play a key role in introducing and promoting new technologies, facilitating international trade and enabling the efficient use of resources. However, the world still has a long way to go to fully tap this potential. LDCs, in particular, need to accelerate the development of their manufacturing sector if they are to meet the 2030 target, and scale up investment in scientific research and innovation. On a positive note, the carbon intensity of manufacturing industries declined at an annual rate of almost 3 per cent from 2010 and 2016, showing a general decoupling of CO emissions and GDP growth. Total official flows for economic infrastructure in developing countries reached $59 billion in 2017, an increase of 32.5 per cent in real terms since 2010. Further, impressive gains have been made in mobile connectivity.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
644;Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have permeated practically all aspects of life. Just a decade ago, in some parts of the globe, prioritizing access to ICTs was considered a luxury. Today, it is widely acknowledged that investing in affordable, universal and unconditional access to ICTs is necessary to drive progress on global priorities, in particular, the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
645;Innovation policies are central to growth agendas in most countries, but have figured much less prominently in strategies to promote social inclusion. In recent years, many countries have implemented “inclusive innovation policies”– a specific set of innovation policies that aim to boost the capacities and opportunities of disadvantaged individuals to engage in innovation activities, including research and entrepreneurship. Examples include the provision of grants to researchers from disadvantaged groups, the deployment of programmes to popularise science and technology, the provision of micro-credit to entrepreneurs and the provision of grants to firms locating their R&D activities in peripheral regions. This paper analyses the role that inclusive innovation policies can play in tackling social, industrial and territorial inclusiveness challenges by drawing on 33 detailed policy examples from 15 countries. The paper discusses why these policies should be a priority, explores the specific challenges that arise in their implementation and provides recommendations as to how the challenges can best be addressed.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
646;Investing in infrastructure, promoting inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and supporting technological development, research and innovation are three driving forces for economic growth and sustainable development. These drivers can help countries reduce poverty by creating job opportunities, stimulating growth, and encouraging the building and improvement of physical facilities that are essential to the functioning of business and society. In recent years, steady improvements have been made in all three of these areas of sustainable development. However, renewed investment will be needed in the least developed countries (LDCs) to build infrastructure and ensure the doubling of industry’s share of GDP in those countries by 2030.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
647;All too often, it is assumed that improvements in ICT connectivity rates will automatically translate into improvements in development. In fact, as ITU has long been highlighting, this can only be the case where an enabling environment with flexible and adaptive ICT regulatory frameworks are in place, to capitalize on the benefits of the digital revolution. Indeed, ITU organizes the annual Global Symposium for Regulators (GSR) to debate new and emerging ICT regulatory issues in ICT. Real-world drivers and constraints cannot be neglected at the expense of the virtual world – we need concerted efforts to harness the power of ICTs and the online world to enrich people’s lives.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
648;Embracing new technologies that could enable drastic reductions in GHG emissions will be key to delivering low-emissions pathways for growth, but it is not always obvious what the big breakthroughs will look like. This report looks at how blockchain technology can be applied to support sustainable infrastructure investment that is aligned with climate change objectives. It focuses on three key points: the financing of infrastructure initiatives, the creation of visibility and alignment of climate action, and the provisioning of awareness and access for institutions and consumers.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
649;The last chapter recognized that building a digital infrastructure has to be a key part of any strategy to help developing countries grasp the benefits of emerging digital technologies. It also suggested that the strong scale and network effects exhibited by that infrastructure can give rise to economic rents and warned that leaving its provision to corporate interests rather than giving a lead role to public policy would probably skew outcomes in ways that would be neither inclusive nor sustainable, particularly in developing countries.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
650;Advancements in science and technology are important drivers of economic growth and well-being and have the potential to help countries leapfrog stages of development. Greater investments are needed to strengthen developing countries’ research capacity and exploit the benefits of modern technologies. Financing Science, Technology and innovation (STI) in a developing country context is difficult, however. This paper tests a novel methodology to assess STI-related development finance starting from development finance data reported to the OECD through the Creditor Reporting System (CRS) database. Using this experimental methodology, total development finance to STI over the past years is estimated. Some suggestions to improve the measurement of STI in a development context are provided. Should that box be removed now?;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
651;This chapter analyses production capabilities – an essential component for the Aid for Trade Initiative to be effective. Past growth in manufacturing and related services sectors has absorbed large numbers of workers into productive jobs and increased the prosperity of their families and communities. Industrialisation and structural transformation remain at the core of many national and regional economic development strategies. In view of greater automation and digitisation, this chapter also discusses the implications of the changing nature of industrialisation and the production process for the future of manufacturing development. Policy lessons are drawn to address “supply side constraints” in manufacturing through aid for trade, which in turn contributes to structural transformation. One theme that re-emerges throughout the chapter is the opportunities industrial policy offers for inclusive and sustainable development. Relevant environmental aspects, like green technologies and energy efficiency, are also considered in the context of economic competitiveness and sustained growth.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
652;Technological developments are fundamentally changing the way firms operate. They are also changing the business ecosystem that surrounds firms. Online platforms have become the place where buyers connect to sellers and increasingly provide other market-relevant information. Contracts are established online and payments are made online, too. In order to take advantage of new opportunities, firms have to deal with and often adopt new technologies. Whether and how to do this will very much be determined by the skills and capacities available in firms. It will also depend on signals that firms receive about the reliability of new technologies and their likelihood of standing the test of time.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
653;There is a considerable need for additional infrastructure investment in many Asian economies, and future increases in population, economic growth and climate change will result in additional demand for infrastructure. As well as increasing investment in infrastructure, policy makers will need to work to ensure the quality of these investments. Quality infrastructure is designed and implemented taking into account a life-cycle perspective, employment creation, social and environmental impacts, alignment with broader development strategies, and resource mobilisation. Quality infrastructure generates positive externalities benefiting economic development and well-being. Examples of the incorporation of these principles in recent road and rail projects in seven Asian countries are discussed in this chapter through 16 case studies.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
654;With a long tradition of supporting innovation behind them, the Nordic countries have always been pacesetters when it comes to innovation-based development, topping the rankings of the most innovative economies in the European Union (EU). According to the Regional Innovation Scoreboard (European Commission, 2017a), Stockholm is the most innovative region in the EU, followed by the capital region of Denmark – Hovedstaden. With the relatively early adoption of the green growth agenda, the Nordic countries have become frontrunners in green economy transformation, having obtained a significant competitive advantage in green solutions.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
655;Technological change is creating a new landscape for businesses today. Fast-paced advances in areas such as artificial intelligence, robotics, 3D printing, nanotechnology and quantum computing are helping to blur the lines between the digital and physical worlds. The far-reaching nature of the transformation has led many to identify it as a fourth industrial revolution, or 4.0 for short.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
656;"Digital transformation has widespread and complex effects across the economy and society. It impacts many policy domains and makes trade-offs between public policy objectives more difficult to navigate. The Going Digital Integrated Policy Framework helps governments and stakeholders to develop an integrated approach to policy making in the digital age and to shape policies for an inclusive digital future. This report outlines the framework’s seven interrelated policy dimensions: 1) access to communications infrastructures, services and data; 2) effective use of digital technologies and data; 3) digital and data-driven innovation; 4) good jobs for all; 5) social prosperity and inclusion; 6) trust in the digital age; and 7) market openness in digital business environments. The report also highlights transversal policy issues (e.g. skills, digital government, SMEs and data) that cut across several policy dimensions. Finally, this report provides guidance on putting the framework into practice.";;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
657;Substantial productivity gaps persist between SMEs and large companies in the Eastern Partner region. Targeted policies should therefore be implemented to foster a productive, innovative, and green SME sector. Pillar E assesses the reforms implemented by governments to support SMEs in overcoming challenges to productivity and promoting innovation.All EaP countries have made progress in the Business development services dimension as all governments have incorporated BDS provision into relevant strategic frameworks. They have also advanced in the Innovation policy dimension with dedicated national strategies adopted, awaiting governmental approval, or underway. However, the focus on SMEs is still limited and monitoring tools remain underutilised. The EaP countries have also made some progress in the Green economy dimension, as policies that support the greening of SMEs have been introduced, albeit with varying degrees of detail.Further challenges involve the development of incentives for private BDS expansion, the promotion of formal and informal channels for science-industry interactions, and the strengthening of green SME policies by linking them to concrete action plans with measurable targets and timeframes, as well as raising awareness among SMEs of the benefits of adopting green practices.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
658;The publication seeks to deepen the understanding of the impact of rapid technological change on sustainable development, especially the consequences for the central principle of the 2030 Agenda of “leaving no one behind”, and the implications for the science, technology and innovation community. It examines the opportunities, risks and challenges brought about by rapid technological change, and looks at the role of science, technology and innovation (STI) policy. It identifies strategies, policies and immediate actions to take to use science, technology and innovation to empower people, especially those who are vulnerable, and ensure inclusiveness and equality.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
659;This chapter describes the main actors in the Costa Rican innovation system – business enterprises, higher education institutions and public research organisations – and highlights their respective roles in the development of innovation activities in recent years. It reviews competences for innovation, and related strengths and weaknesses.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
660;This chapter outlines the main business actors in innovation and their performance, and discusses the main innovation challenges facing the Austrian business sector today. It analyses public support for business innovation and entrepreneurship as well as the innovation capacity of the Austrian business sector. It discusses improving early stage equity financing and investment readiness as well as supporting management and leadership development. The chapter continues to illustrate the current policy mix to support business R&D and describes possible avenues to better respond to future needs in this area. The chapter further discusses Industry 4.0 by providing an overview of key areas that enable harnessing the benefits of respective technologies, including cloud computing, the supply and use of data, 5G networks and Austria’s readiness for technology diffusion.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
661;Digital technologies have already transformed how people communicate, learn, work and shop. They are also changing the geography of economic activity through their impact on corporate strategy, investment behaviour and trade flows. From a development perspective, the promise of digitalization is that it will open new sectors, promote new markets, boost innovation and generate the productivity gains needed to lift living standards in developing countries. Fulfilling this promise of a new digital future will, for many developing countries, require an ambitious programme of infrastructure support and skills training. However, assessing the wider use and impact of these new technologies, particularly with respect to the 2030 Development Agenda, cannot be divorced from the economic environment in which they are nested.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
662;"Policies to support ICT investment are a strategic tool to spur the digital transformation and enhance productivity and growth. However, while most countries do carry out some forms of ICT investment policy, very little is known on the effects of these policies. In order to start filling this gap, this report presents an overview of recent trends in ICT investment in OECD countries; makes an inventory of ICT investment policies in OECD and selected Partner economies; and reviews the evaluation of selected investment programmes in some OECD countries.";;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
663;1 2017 HLFP Thematic Review of SDG-9: Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization and foster innovation1 A global perspective on SDG-9 SDG-9 is built on three pillars, infrastructure, industry and innovation, all of which are strongly connected among themselves and share the common goal of achieving socially inclusive and environmentally sustainable economic development. Over the past decades regions such as East and South Asia have made remarkable progress in achieving development goals in the areas of infrastructure, industrialization and innovation.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
664;However, achieving Goal 9 by 2030 will require addressing a range of resource constraints, especially in the context of developing countries vulnerable countries including the least developed countries (LDCs), Landlocked Developing Countries (LLDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS). Countries will have to strengthen their capabilities and explore new ways to solve development challenges by involving various actors, processes and types of governance, source of finance and encourage collaboration and cooperation across stakeholders, sectors and regions. The industrial sector proves to be particularly challenging in geographical areas such as Sub-Saharan Africa, whose industrialization levels remain low or have stagnated, thus undergoing a much slower pace of progress in poverty eradication. By adopting Goal 9 in particular, the global community addresses these and other challenges by committing itself to an industrial development that is inclusive and sustainable (ISID), thus highlighting close linkages with virtually all other SDGs as regards job creation, sustainable livelihoods, SME development, better health, technology and skills development, food security, green technologies, environmental protection, building resilient cities and climate change mitigation.;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;
665;"There are many different indicators and metrics to evaluate industry, innovation and infrastructure. This paper discusses just a few of them – global manufacturing employment; mobile and Internet penetration, R&D expenditure & staff, and medium- and high-tech value-added in total value-added. A global perspective on the status of SDG-9 and its related targets indicates that, for example regarding target 9.2 2 , progress in global manufacturing employment over time shows a somewhat mixed trend. Global employment in manufacturing and manufacturing-related services (direct and indirect) has grown from an estimated 262 million in 1970, to 482 million in 2014, an average yearly growth rate of 1.4 per cent. In relative terms, however, manufacturing employment has decreased from 18.7 to 16 per 1 This background note has been developed by members of ECESA Plus as a coordinated contribution by the UN system to the 2017 HLPF in depth review of SDG 9.";;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;;

695;10.c By 2030, reduce to less than 3 per cent the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate remittance corridors with costs higher than 5 per cent;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
696;Goal 10 calls for reducing inequalities in income as well as those based on age, sex, disability, race, ethnicity, origin, religion or economic or other status within a country. The Goal also addresses inequalities among countries, including those related to representation, migration and development assistance.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
697;Target 10.1 seeks to ensure that income growth among the poorest 40 per cent of the population in every country is more rapid than its national average. This was true in 56 of 94 countries with data available from 2007 to 2012. However, this does not necessarily imply greater prosperity, since nine of those countries experienced negative growth rates over that period.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
698;The labour share of GDP, which represents the proportion of wages and social protection transfers in an economy, provides an aggregate measure of primary income inequality. A shift of income away from labour towards capital has contributed to rising inequality. Globally, the labour share of GDP decreased from 57 per cent in 2000 to 55 per cent in 2015, mainly owing to stagnating wages and a decline in employers’ social contributions in developed regions, while the trend was stable or slightly upward in developing regions.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
699;In 2016, over 64.4 per cent of products exported by LDCs to world markets and 64.1 per cent of those from SIDS faced zero tariffs, an increase of 20 per cent since 2010. Developing countries overall had duty-free market access for about 50 per cent of all products exported in 2016.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
700;"In 2016, receipts by developing countries from member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of the OECD, multilateral agencies and other key providers totalled $315 billion; of this amount, $158 billion was ODA. In 2016, total ODA to LDCs and SIDS from all donors totalled $43.1 billion and $6.2 billion, respectively.";;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
701;The voices of developing countries still need to be strengthened in decisio n-making forums of international economic and financial institutions. Moreover, while remittances can be a lifeline for families and communities of international migrant workers in their countries of origin, the high cost of transferring money continues to reduce such benefits.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
702;The International Monetary Fund, through its recent quota reform, has increased the share of developing countries’ vote (defined as countries in developing regions, according to the M49 classification) to 37 per cent in 2016, up from 33 per cent in 2010. That increase is still short of the 74 per cent they represent in the membership. While the World Bank reforms of 2010 are still being implemented, that effort has not changed the 38 per cent share of voting rights at the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development that developing countries have held since 2000.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
703;"Duty-free treatment and favourable access conditions for exports from least developed and developing countries have expanded. From 2005 to 2015, the proportion of tariff lines globally with duty-free treatment for products that originate in developing countries increased from 41 per cent to 50 per cent; for products that originate in the least developed countries, the proportion rose from 49 per cent to 65 per cent.";;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
704;The least developed countries and small island developing States continue to require additional assistance to ensure that they share in the benefits of sustainable development. In 2015, total resource flows to the least developed countries and small island developing States amounted to $48 billion and $6 billion, respectively. Eight donor countries met the target of 0.15 per cent of gross national income (GNI) for ODA to the least developed countries.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
705;"The benefits of remittance from international migrant workers are reduced somewhat by the generally high cost of transfer. On average, post offices and money transfer operators charge over 6 per cent of the amount remitted; commercial banks charge 11 per cent. Both are significantly above the 3 per cent target. New and improved technologies, such as prepaid cards and mobile operators, result in lower fees for sending money home (between 2 per cent and 4 per cent), but are not yet widely available or used for many remittance corridors.";;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
706;There are a wide variety of types of economic inequality, most notably measured using the distribution of income (the amount of money people are paid) and the distribution of wealth (the amount of wealth people own). Besides economic inequality between countries or states, there are important types of economic inequality between different groups of people.Important types of economic measurements focus on wealth, income, and consumption. There are many methods for measuring economic inequality, with the Gini coefficient being a widely used one.  Another type of measure is the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, which is a statistic composite index that takes inequality into account. Important concepts of equality include equity, equality of outcome, and equality of opportunity.\nResearch suggests that greater inequality hinders economic growth, with land and human capital inequality reducing growth more than inequality of income. Whereas globalization has reduced global inequality (between nations), it has increased inequality within nations.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
707;"Over the past five decades, substantial attention has been placed on the role of economic growth in reducing poverty. This is premised on the trickle-down effect of long-term economic growth on poverty and inequality, based on Simon Kuznets’ theory. However, evidence across the world has shown that high economic growth and rapid reduction in poverty do not automatically translate into accelerated reduction in inequality (Stiglitz, 2015; Reid-Henry, 2015; Piketty, 2015). China and Rwanda provide some good examples of the lack of trickle-down effect on inequality where rapid economic growth has been accompanied by rising income inequality. The global inequality crisis – where the richest 1 per cent of the world’s population has more wealth than the rest of the world combined – has disproved Kuznets’ theory and has further questioned the efficacy of fiscal policies in promoting economic efficiency and development effectiveness.";;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
708;Income inequality has increased in most OECD countries over the past two decades. This is both because market incomes (wages, dividends, interest income) have become more unequally distributed, and also because redistribution through taxes and transfers has fallen. New OECD work explores cross-country evidence on trends in income redistribution since the mid-1990s to shed some light on the main drivers of the general decline.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
709;Humankind has achieved unprecedented social progress over the past several decades. Poverty has declined dramatically around the world and people are healthier, more educated and better connected than ever before. However, this progress has been uneven. Social and economic inequalities persist and, in many cases, have worsened. Virtually everywhere, some individuals and groups confront barriers that prevent them from fully participating in economic, social and political life.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
710;Goal 10 calls for reducing inequalities in income, as well as those based on sex, age, disability, race, class, ethnicity, religion and opportunity—both within and among countries. World leaders recognized the positive contribution of international migration to inclusive growth and sustainable development, while acknowledging that it demands coherent and comprehensive responses. Accordingly, they committed to cooperate internationally to ensure safe, orderly and regular migration. The Goal also addresses issues related to representation of developing countries in global decision-making and development assistance.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
711;"This paper produces a comprehensive assessment of income redistribution to the working-age population, covering OECD countries over the last two decades. Redistribution is quantified as the relative reduction in market income inequality achieved by personal income taxes, employees’ social security contributions and cash transfers, based on household-level micro data. A detailed decomposition analysis uncovers the respective roles of size, tax progressivity and transfer targeting for overall redistribution, the respective role of various categories of transfers for transfer redistribution; as well as redistribution for various income groups. The paper shows a widespread decline in redistribution across the OECD, both on average and in the majority of countries for which data going back to the mid-1990s are available. This was primarily associated with a decline in cash transfer redistribution while personal income taxes played a less important and more heterogeneous role across countries. In turn, the decline in the redistributive effect of cash transfers reflected a decline in their size and in particular by less redistributive insurance transfers. In some countries, this was mitigated by more redistributive assistance transfers but the resulting increase in the targeting of total transfers was not sufficient to prevent transfer redistribution from declining.";;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
712;We provide an overview of inequality developments in the Nordics compared to other OECD countries, starting from the early 1990s. Some of the largest inequality increases in the OECD have taken place in Sweden, Finland and Denmark, but from very low initial levels. A coherent set of institutions underpin high employment and have likely dampened the inequality-increasing forces from skill-biased technological change and globalisation. Demographic trends have increased inequality in the Nordics, but the main mechanisms vary between countries. Redistribution has weakened considerably, mainly driven by weaker insurance transfers to working-age individuals, but these reforms have contributed to including more people in the labour market.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
713;This chapter considers social mobility from an intra-generational perspective and analyses income mobility over the life course. The chapter explores to which extent levels of income inequality change when taking income mobility into account – so called “permanent inequality”. It identifies the extent of income persistence at both ends of the income distribution in OECD countries and selected major emerging economies – “sticky floors” and “sticky ceilings”. The chapter provides evidence on trends in income mobility between the late 1990s and the early 2010s. It also analyses the structure of income changes and the role of unpredictable “income shocks” for explaining those changes, in particular at the bottom of the income distribution.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
714;High and persistent inequalities of outcome are a source of concern because they undermine the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and the associated Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Among several adverse implications, they can lead to a deceleration of economic growth, hamper efforts aimed at eliminating extreme poverty and hunger, and weaken bonds of solidarity at the community level. Inequalities of outcome also correlate with political capture, especially by vested interest groups. A disproportionate political influence of the rich over policymaking increases rent-seeking activities at the expense of the broader society, hence undermining the global aspiration of “leaving no one behind”. Addressing deepening and persisting inequalities is also important to foster peace and prevent within-country conflicts.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
715;"This paper provides new empirical evidence on the effects of structural policies on household disposable incomes at different income levels. More specifically, it investigates the extent to which structural policies have differential long-run impacts on GDP per capita and on household incomes at different points of the distribution. One aim is to verify whether policy decisions may face tradeoffs between objectives of economic efficiency and equity. Many growth enhancing structural reforms are found to deliver stronger income gains for households at the lower end of the distribution compared with the average household, an indication that they may reduce inequality in disposable incomes. Such is the case of reducing regulatory barriers to domestic competition as well as to trade and FDI; stepping-up job-search support and activation programmes. Conversely, other reforms involve trade-offs between the efficiency and equity objective. This is the case of the tightening of unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed, which is found to lift GDP per capita and average household incomes, but also to reduce disposable incomes at the lower end of the distribution.";;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
716;The levels and dimensions of income inequality in Africa are heterogeneous, with varying degrees of intensity, diversity and drivers. Since 1990, income inequality trends in the continent have been multi-dimensional, exhibiting a rising, a falling, a U-shaped, or an inverted U-shaped (∩) trends. These variations emphasise the importance of achieving a deeper understanding of each of these trends in Africa towards identifying key drivers and to offer policy recommendations for the countries associated with each trend. Focusing on specific drivers of progress on income inequality allows for a clear understanding of why some countries make significant progress while others lag behind. This focus also makes it possible to draw policy lessons regarding human and institutional factors that define successes and failures in African countries.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
717;"This paper delivers a broad assessment of income inequality in Denmark. As a necessary preamble to provide a basis for discussion, we start by contrasting Danish official inequality measures with those gathered by the OECD in an international context. We show that differences between these two sources are fully explained by differences in methodological choices. We then go beyond synthetic measures of inequality to deliver a granular assessment of income distribution and of the distributional impact of taxes and transfers; and on this basis we compare Denmark to other OECD countries. This approach is then used to quantify the distributional impact of some growth-enhancing reforms undertaken or recommended for Denmark, based on empirical evidence across OECD countries. Finally, we take a forward looking stance by discussing global forces shaping the rise in inequality, in particular skill-biased technological change and deliver a tentative scenario for Denmark in the wider OECD context.";;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
718;In a majority of OECD countries, GDP growth over the past three decades has been associated with growing income disparities. To shed some lights on the potential sources of trade-offs between growth and equity, this paper investigates the long-run impact of structural reforms on household incomes across the distribution, hence on income inequality. The paper builds on a macro-micro approach by combining recent macro-level estimates of the impact of structural reforms on macroeconomic growth with micro-level estimates of the impact of structural reforms on household incomes across the income distribution. It considers the sources of macroeconomic growth, by decomposing growth in GDP per capita into growth in labour utilisation and labour productivity. This allows for shedding light on the mechanisms through which growth and its drivers, including policy drivers, benefit household incomes at different points of the income distribution. Most structural reforms are found to have little impact on income inequality when the latter is assessed through measures that emphasise the middle class. By contrast, a higher number of structural reforms, in particular social protection reforms, are found to have an impact on income inequality and thus may raise tradeoffs and synergies between growth equity objectives when inequality is assessed through measures that emphasise relatively more incomes among the poor. This corresponds to higher degrees of inequality aversion.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
719;This paper looks at the incidence of fiscal policy on the income distribution for Chile and Mexico. Notably by broadening the income concept to account for in-kind benefits and taxes, this paper provides a full picture of the effect of fiscal policy on reducing income inequality. The contrast between the estimates for Chile and Mexico and the rest of OECD countries provides an overall snapshot of income distribution of high inequality countries vis-à-vis advanced economies. The breakdown of the Gini coefficient at a detailed level of policy instruments also enables us to identify the main channels of income inequality reduction and shows how these results differ across countries. Our results for Chile and Mexico suggest that fiscal policy significantly benefits the poorest income groups, mainly through in-kind services such as education and health care. Nevertheless, when compared with outcomes in high-income countries, the effectiveness of fiscal policy in reducing inequality is still limited. Cash transfers (especially those for old-age programmes), direct taxation and, to some extent, a higher market inequality are the main factors behind this difference.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
720;In the current environment of protracted trade tensions and high policy uncertainty, the global growth outlook has weakened significantly. This threatens to undermine progress towards eradicating poverty, raising living standards, and creating a sufficient number of decent jobs. The broad-based growth slowdown in the world economy over the past year has been accompanied by a sharp slowdown in international trade flows and global manufacturing activity. Amid rising tariffs and rapid shifts in trade policies, business confidence has deteriorated, dampening investment growth across most regions. Softening demand has also weighed on global commodity prices, in particular crude oil and industrial metals. While the global shift towards more accommodative monetary policies has eased short-term financial market pressures somewhat, long-term fault lines create significant uncertainty.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
721;The present paper shows the results of an empirical study to prove that income inequality has increased over the past decades. To conduct the study, an income inequality dataset containing 133 countries over the 1990-2014 period was created. The results indicate that globally, income inequality (population-weighted Gini coefficients), on average, increased from 38.6 to 41.8 during that period. They further show the existence of variations in the level of income inequality across regions and groups of countries. The reduction in income inequality, among others, remains one of the key challenges associated with the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Therefore, in this paper, various transmission mechanisms and drivers of the increasing level of income inequality are identified and possible forward-looking development policies to reduce income inequality are given.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
722;"Costa Rica is one of the countries that spends the most on social policies in Latin America, although considerably less than the OECD average. Social spending in Costa Rica focuses on public services. Cash social benefits fail to significantly reduce income inequality due to small size and low progressivity. Public services, in turn, have considerable redistributive impact due to large spending and favouring lower income households. Taxes do not reduce inequality and may hinder employment and formality due to over-reliance on social contributions. The pension system’s coverage is high but not universal. Further improvements in family policies; childcare and parental leave policies are needed to tackle key barriers for female labour market participation and taxes and benefits could contribute to reducing high child poverty among working families Finally, urgent action is needed in the area of anti-poverty policies which largely remain fragmented and un-coordinated.";;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;
723;While the aggregate costs of inequality of outcome can be high, the impact of inequality is perhaps more corrosive at the individual or the household level. So far, research and headlines on inequality have emphasized the most glaring contrasts: the lavish lives of billionaires compared with the uncertainty, stagnant wages and exploitation that are often experienced by the poorest people in society. Global analysts have tended to overlook the impact of income and wealth inequality on accessing basic opportunities, including quality education and health care, meaningful work and decent living conditions.;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;;

755;Between 1990 and 2016, the proportion of the global urban population living in slums fell from 46 to 23 per cent. This progress was largely offset by internal population growth and rural-urban migration. In 2016, just over 1 billion people lived in slums or informal settlements, with over half (589 million) living in East, South-East, Central and South Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
756;The proportion of urban residents who have convenient access to public transport (defined as living within 500 m walking distance of a bus stop and within 1,000 m of a railway and/or ferry terminal) remains low, particularly in developing countries. Based on data from 227 cities from 78 countries in 2018, on average, 53 per cent of urban residents in all regions had convenient access to public transport, from a low of 18 per cent in sub-Saharan Africa to a high of 75 per cent in Australia and New Zealand. In some regions that have low access to public transport, informal transport modes are highly prevalent and in many cases provide reliable transport for the majority of urban populations.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
757;Globally, urban areas are expanding at a faster rate than their populations. Between 2000 and 2014, areas occupied by cities grew 1.28 times faster than their populations. Closely related to this trend is that the urban densities of cities have been declining, creating profound repercussions for environmental sustainability at the local, regional and global scale. Better management of urban growth will be crucial in order to guarantee sustainable urbanization.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
758;Globally, 2 billion people do not have access to waste collection services and 3 billion people lack access to controlled waste disposal facilities. With increasing urban populations and the existence of consumer-oriented economies amid rising income levels and rapid urbanization, it is estimated that the total waste generated in the world will double from nearly 2 billion tons in 2016 to about 4 billion tons by 2050. While from 2010 to 2018 the proportion of solid waste collected was about 81 per cent globally, in sub-Saharan Africa it was only 52 per cent.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
759;In 2016, 9 in 10 people living in urban areas still breathed air that did not meet the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines value for particulate matter – that particulate matter 2.5 microns or less in size (PM2.5) not exceed an annual mean of 10 micrograms per m3 or a daily mean of 25 micrograms per m3 – and more than half of the world population experienced an increase in PM2.5 from 2010 to 2016.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
760;Most cities have struggled to ensure that their populations have convenient access to open public spaces (defined as spaces within 400 m walking distance of their residence). Based on data from 220 cities in 77 countries in 2018, only 21 per cent of the population had convenient access to open public spaces. However, these results do not necessarily mean that there is an inadequate share of land dedicated to open public spaces in these cities, but rather that their distribution across urban areas is uneven.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
761;Between 2000 and 2014, the proportion of the global urban population living in slums dropped from 28.4 per cent to 22.8 per cent. However, the actual number of people living in slums increased from 807 million to 883 million.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
762;Based on data collected for 214 cities/municipalities, about three quarters of municipal solid waste generated is collected.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
763;"In 2016, 91 per cent of the urban population worldwide were breathing air that did not meet the World Health Organization air quality guidelines value for particulate matter (PM 2.5); more than half were exposed to air pollution levels at least 2.5 times higher than that safety standard. In 2016, an estimated 4.2 million people died as a result of high levels of ambient air pollution.";;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
764;The safe removal and management of solid waste represents one of the most vital urban environmental services. Uncollected solid waste blocks drains, causes flooding and may lead to the spread of water-borne diseases. On the basis of data from cities in 101 countries from 2009 to 2013, 65 per cent of the urban population was served by municipal waste collection.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
765;"A metropolis () is a large city or conurbation which is a significant economic, political, and cultural center for a country or region, and an important hub for regional or international connections, commerce, and communications. The term is Ancient Greek (μητρόπολις) and means the ""mother city"" of a colony (in the ancient sense), that is, the city which sent out settlers. This was later generalized to a city regarded as a center of a specified activity, or any large, important city in a nation.\nA big city belonging to a larger urban agglomeration, but which is not the core of that agglomeration, is not generally considered a metropolis but a part of it. The plural of the word is metropolises, although the Latin plural is metropoles, from the Greek metropoleis (μητρoπόλεις).\nFor urban centers outside metropolitan areas that generate a similar attraction on a smaller scale for their region, the concept of the regiopolis (""regio"" for short) was introduced by urban and regional planning researchers in Germany in 2006.";;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
766;A city is a large human settlement. It can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non-agricultural tasks. Cities generally have extensive systems for housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, and communication. Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organisations and businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process, such as improving efficiency of goods and service distribution. This concentration also can have significant negative consequences, such as forming urban heat islands, concentrating pollution, and stressing water supplies and other resources.\nHistorically, city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall, but following two centuries of unprecedented and rapid urbanisation, roughly half of the world population now lives in cities, which has had profound consequences for global sustainability. Present-day cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areas—creating numerous commuters traveling towards city centres for employment, entertainment, and edification. However, in a world of intensifying globalisation, all cities are to varying degrees also connected globally beyond these regions. This increased influence means that cities also have significant influences on global issues, such as sustainable development, global warming and global health.\nOther important traits of cities besides population include the capital status and relative continued occupation of the city. For example, country capitals such as Abu Dhabi, Beijing, Berlin, Cairo, London, Moscow, Paris, Rome, Seoul, Tokyo, Taipei, and Washington, D.C. reflect their nation's identity. Some historic capitals, such as Kyoto, maintain their reflection of cultural identity even without modern capital status. Religious holy sites offer another example of capital status within a religion, Jerusalem, Mecca, and Varanasi each hold significance. The cities of Faiyum, Damascus, and Argos are among those laying claim to the longest continual inhabitation. In terms of relative age, the oldest cities in the Americas are Cholula near Puebla, Florés in Petén, and Acoma near Albuquerque, while the oldest capital cities in the Americas are Mexico City, Santo Domingo, and San Juan. Another example of relative age, is in the age of the oldest capital cities of the superpower and emerging superpower, they are the U.S. state capital of Santa Fe, New Mexico, and the Chinese prefecture capital of Xi'an, Shaanxi.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
767;"An urban area, or built-up area, is a human settlement with a high population density and infrastructure of built environment. Urban areas are created through urbanization and are categorized by urban morphology as cities, towns, conurbations or suburbs. In urbanism, the term contrasts to rural areas such as villages and hamlets; in urban sociology or urban anthropology it contrasts with natural environment. The creation of early predecessors of urban areas during the urban revolution led to the creation of human civilization with modern urban planning, which along with other human activities such as exploitation of natural resources led to a human impact on the environment. ""Agglomeration effects"" are in the list of the main consequences of increased rates of firm creation since. This is due to conditions created by a greater level of industrial activity in a given region. However, a favorable environment for human capital development would also be generated simultaneously.The world\'s urban population in 1950 of just 746 million has increased to 3.9 billion in the decades since. In 2009, the number of people living in urban areas (3.42 billion) surpassed the number living in rural areas (3.41 billion), and since then the world has become more urban than rural. This was the first time that the majority of the world\'s population lived in a city. In 2014 there were 7.2 billion people living on the planet, of which the global urban population comprised 3.9 billion.";;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
768;"The Population Division of the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs at that time predicted the urban population would grow to 6.4 billion by 2050, with 37% of that growth to come from three countries: China, India and Nigeria.\nThe UN publishes data on cities, urban areas and rural areas, but relies almost entirely on national definitions of these areas. The UN principles and recommendations state that due to different characteristics of urban and rural areas across the globe, a global definition is not possible.\nUrban areas are created and further developed by the process of urbanization. Urban areas are measured for various purposes, including analyzing population density and urban sprawl.\nUnlike an urban area, a metropolitan area includes not only the urban area, but also satellite cities plus intervening rural land that is socio-economically connected to the urban core city, typically by employment ties through commuting, with the urban core city being the primary labor market.\nThe concept of an ""urban area"" as used in economic statistics should not be confused with the concept of the ""urban area"" used in road safety statistics. The last concept is also known as ""built-up area in road safety"". According to the definition by the Office for National Statistics, ""Built-up areas are defined as land which is \'irreversibly urban in character\', meaning that they are characteristic of a town or city. They include areas of built-up land with a minimum of 20 hectares (200,000 m2; 49 acres). Any areas [separated by] less than 200 metres [of non-urban space] are linked to become a single built-up area.";;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
769;A residential area is a land used in which housing predominates, as opposed to industrial and commercial areas. \nHousing may vary significantly between, and through, residential areas. These include single-family housing, multi-family residential, or mobile homes. Zoning for residential use may permit some services or work opportunities or may totally exclude business and industry. It may permit high density land use or only permit low density uses.  Residential zoning usually includes a smaller FAR (floor area ratio) than business, commercial or industrial/manufacturing zoning. The area may be large or small.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
770;"A community is a social unit (a group of living things) with commonality such as norms, religion, values, customs, or identity.  Communities may share a sense of place situated in a given geographical area (e.g. a country, village, town, or neighbourhood) or in virtual space through communication platforms. Durable relations that extend beyond immediate genealogical ties also define a sense of community, important to their identity, practice, and roles in social institutions such as family, home, work, government, society, or humanity at large. Although communities are usually small relative to personal social ties, ""community"" may also refer to large group affiliations such as national communities, international communities, and virtual communities.The English-language word ""community"" derives from the Old French comuneté (currently ""Communauté""), which comes from the Latin communitas ""community"", ""public spirit"" (from Latin communis, ""common"").Human communities may share intent, belief, resources, preferences, needs, and risks in common, affecting the identity of the participants and their degree of cohesiveness.')";;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
771;"Goal 11 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development: Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable calls for better planning and investment in cities and informal settlements to improve the quality of lives of people living in urban areas. Africa’s urbanization process is a transformative force and a development priority for the region. Africa’s speed and scale of urbanization, compared with other world regions, will position the continent as an urban region in less than two decades. Urbanization can be a vehicle to create wealth, generate employment and drive human progress by harnessing agglomeration forces and industrialization for inclusive and sustainable development. Nonetheless, African cities are not coping with adequate planning and managing the rapid urban growth occurring in many countries. Effective implementation strategies and tracking mechanisms are critical for achieving targets that countries have committed to as outlined in: SDG 11; Aspiration 1 and Priority 4, of Agenda 2063, The Africa We Want; and the New Urban Agenda.";;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
772;Shaping urbanization for children, a handbook on child-responsive urban planning, presents concepts, evidence and technical strategies to bring children to the foreground of urban planning.

773;This chapter analyses the residential sector from a well-being perspective and proposes a number of policy priorities that are consistent with wider well-being and sustainability goals. It explores several indicators that can improve policy makers’ ability to monitor progress in delivering these priorities in the sector, as well as guide decisions to capture the benefits of a two-way alignment between climate and wider well-being goals, while also managing trade-offs. The chapter examines the relationship between the proposed indicators and the indicators used by the Sustainable Development Goals and the OECD Framework for Measuring Well-being and Progress.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
774;This chapter is dedicated to the transport sector, with a focus on surface transport. It discusses policy priorities that are central for the sector to contribute to current and future well-being objectives.

The chapter also examines the relation between the indicators proposed, and indicators used by the Sustainable Development Goals and the OECD Framework for Measuring Well-being and Progress.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
775;This report by UNICEF reveals that not all children in cities benefit from the so-called ‘urban advantage’—the notion that higher incomes, better infrastructure, and proximity to services grant urban children advantages over rural children. In fact, urban inequality and exclusion among children in cities can make many of the most disadvantaged children in urban areas worse off than children in rural areas. Hence, the ‘urban paradox.’;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
776;New Zealand’s housing supply has not kept pace with rising demand, including from net immigration. Affordability has worsened, particularly for low-income renters. Government action is underway to allow new housing through initiatives such as the Urban Growth Agenda, KiwiBuild and the Housing and Urban Development Authority, but further steps are needed to improve well-being. Clear overarching principles for sustainable urban development and rationalisation of strict regulatory containment policies would allow the planning system to better respond to demand for land. Incentives for local governments to accommodate growth could be increased by giving them access to additional revenue linked to local development. More user charging and targeted rates would also help to fund infrastructure required to service new housing. Government delivery of affordable housing through KiwiBuild should be re‑focused towards enabling the supply of land to developers, supporting development of affordable rental housing and further expanding social housing in areas facing shortages.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
777;The future of the world’s population is urban. With more than half of the world’s people living in urban areas (55 per cent, up from 30 per cent in 1950), urbanization determines the spatial distribution of the world’s population and is one of the four demographic mega-trends, with the growth of the global population, population ageing, and international migration. Estimates and projections of urbanization introduced in this report indicate that the future growth of the human population can be accounted for almost entirely by a growing number of city dwellers. By mid-century, roughly two thirds (68 per cent) of the world’s population will be living in urban areas. The global urban population is projected to grow by 2.5 billion urban dwellers between 2018 and 2050, with nearly 90 per cent of the increase concentrated in Asia and Africa. In many regions, the share of population living in cities, as well as the number and size of cities, will continue to grow, driven by a combination of factors, including a surplus of births over deaths in urban areas, migration from rural to urban areas and from abroad (Lerch, 2017) as well as the urbanization of formerly rural areas. Urbanization is also transforming the lives of those living in the rural areas around cities. Cities are major gateways and destinations for internal and international migrants and migration needs to be integrated into the strategic planning and management of cities and urban systems.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
778;The world is becoming increasingly urbanized. Since 2007, more than half the world’s population has been living in cities, and that share is projected to rise to 60 per cent by 2030. Cities and metropolitan areas are powerhouses of economic growth—contributing about 60 per cent of global GDP. However, they also account for about 70 per cent of global carbon emissions and over 60 per cent of resource use. Rapid urbanization is resulting in a growing number of slum dwellers, inadequate and overburdened infrastructure and services (such as waste collection and water and sanitation systems, roads and transport), worsening air pollution and unplanned urban sprawl. To respond to those challenges, 150 countries have developed national urban plans, with almost half of them in the implementation phase. Ensuring that those plans are well executed will help cities grow in a more sustainable and inclusive manner.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
779;As the world becomes increasingly urbanized, many countries face growing numbers of slum dwellers, worsening air quality and insufficient basic urban services and infrastructure. Urban sprawl continues, with the physical expansion of cities increasing at a rate 1.5 times that of population growth, highlighting the need for better urban planning and more efficient transportation systems. To address many of these challenges, 152 countries have developed national urban policies that support sustainable urbanization. Although progress is being made, efforts must be redoubled to ensure that all urban inhabitants have access to safe and adequate housing, clean air and basic services, and live in resilient and sustainable communities.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
780;The pace of urban growth has been unprecedented. Around the turn of the century, for the first time in history, urban dwellers outnumbered their rural counterparts, and by 2015, nearly 4 billion people—54 per cent of the world’s population—lived in cities. That number is projected to reach 5 billion by 2030. Rapid urbanization brings enormous challenges, including growing numbers of slum dwellers, increased air pollution, inadequate basic services and infrastructure, and unplanned urban sprawl— which also make cities more vulnerable to disasters. With sound urban planning and management, however, the world’s urban spaces can become inclusive, safe, resilient and sustainable, as well as dynamic hubs of innovation and enterprise.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
781;The UNECE Real Estate Market Advisory Group (REM) is a group of real estate experts who advise the Committee on Urban Development, Housing and Land Management on sustainable real estate markets, working to identify specific measures to strengthen a country’s real estate market in a manner that would contribute to economic growth and sustainable development. In 2010, the REM Advisory Group published the “Policy Framework for Sustainable Real Estate Markets”, a tool that would help guide the member States to create sustainable real estate markets. However, the emergence of key international agreements, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Geneva UN Charter on Sustainable Housing, the New Urban Agenda, the Paris Agreement, and the Basel III Agreement, have led to the establishment of new global and regional policy frameworks for future activities on sustainable urban development at all levels. In response to the request of the Committee to update the Policy Framework to reflect the emergence of such key agreements, the REM Advisory Group produced the current publication, which now also includes updates on the issues such as urbanization, migration and mobility flows, technology and innovation, the growth of emerging markets and asset competition, the change in housing demand oriented towards green buildings and new designs, energy consumption and climate change, and other relevant phenomena. Moreover, this version of the Policy Framework for Sustainable Real Estate Markets maintains that, contrary to the widespread belief that finance and real estate sectors have negative impact on sustainability, they can actually contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals with the implementation of effective and compatible principles. In particular, this publication shows that these principles can be incorporated by national, local and municipal governments and applied to various forms of real estate.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
782;This report discusses the main results of a project on how an influx of funds could spur development of cleaner public transport, and reduce air pollution and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in large urban centres in Kyrgyzstan, by providing an analysis for designing a green public investment programme in this sector. This sector represents an opportunity for Kyrgyzstan to address key objectives in its environmental and climate-related policies as part of the country’s ambitions to transition to a green economic path of development. The investment programme is also designed to support the modernisation of the urban transport fleet in the country and stimulate the domestic market to shift to modern buses powered by cleaner fuels. The programme is foreseen to be implemented in two phases: the first covers the cities of Bishkek and Osh and the second extends to areas outside of the initial pilot city centres (pilot city suburbs as well as inter-city transport). These investments are expected to result in significant environmental, public service and socio-economic benefits.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
783;This reports benchmarks road safety performance for 72 urban areas, mostly in Europe, and illustrates governance solutions to improve urban road safety with case studies conducted in Lisbon (Portugal) and Riga (Latvia). The report proposes new road safety indicators to assess the level of risk for each mode of transport. It finds that a modal shift away from private motor vehicles could significantly enhance road safety in dense urban areas and deliver public health benefits associated with increased physical activity and improved air quality.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
784;This paper examines the role of rural regions in the economic transformation of Korea. The analysis at regional level reveals that, while having experiencing continued urbanisation and rapid demographic shift of aging and depopulation, the Korean rural areas performs well in terms of productivity growth thanks to the relatively higher share of tradable sectors in rural economies. It also provides the overview of how the rural policy in Korea, which has evolved in response to the socio-economic changes and growing well-being concerns. With the balanced national development at the centre of the national agenda for decades, regional policy approaches have diversified from state-led large projects to flexible policy packages and functional approaches to enhance rural economies and well-being. Finally, the paper presents a number of international policy approaches that can be useful for Korea, including the case of France, Italy and Sweden.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
785;"When heavy rains come in May, residents of neighbourhoods surrounding Wuhan’s Garden Expo in China no longer brace themselves for overflowing sewage as they had done in the days when this 46-hectare site formed the Jinkou landfill, Asia’s largest garbage dump. After a three-year remediation programme, the trash heap, the methane emissions of which regularly caught on fire, had been transformed so that it opened to host the 10th China International Garden Expo in September 2015. This urban ecological restoration project converted a once toxic part of Wuhan, a city of 11 million people, into an award-winning green oasis that creates public space, improves air quality, provides habitat for native wildlife, adapts to climate change and operates on a sustainable financing model (Xinhuanet, 2018; C40 Cities, 2016).1 Employing “sponge city” principles, the Garden Expo site can absorb Wuhan’s subtropical monsoon rainfall (Jing, 2019). According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), monsoon rainfalls are expected to become more intense as climate change creates more extreme weather events (Stocker and others, 2013). While the project cost $690 million, the improvements benefit 400,000 residents in the park’s immediate surroundings, and the municipal government collects revenue from such events as wedding rentals that help recoup the city’s investment.";;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;

With pride, the mayor shares how e-government practices have increased transparency, leading to better budget management and reporting efficiencies; these measures have resulted in greater staff retention and pride in their work. With the savings, the city managed to invest in an operations centre with digital maps showing real time public transport service efficiencies, transport conditions on the roads, rails and waterways. Predictive analytics enable the centre’s traffic engineers to adjust speed limits, traffic lights, toll prices, reversible lanes and bus headways in order to ensure smooth transport flows. Another map shows data on piped water systems highlighting areas of stress or leakage, with an accompanying board tracking usage against water reserves.";;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
787;This chapter examines the territorial development dimension of the State of Hidalgo and suggests how to design urban and rural policies to improve regional development outcomes. It starts with an overview of the well-being conditions in the state. Then, it analyses urban and regional development through metropolitan governance, mobility and spatial planning policies. The third section analyses rural policies, focusing on the agricultural sector and the non-farming opportunities such as tourism. Finally, it reviews the state of the natural capital in the State of Hidalgo.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
788;This chapter discusses the economic and environmental conditions of the Czech Republic’s urban areas, with a particular focus on Prague and Litoměřice. It examines the cities’ main challenges regarding sustainable urban development and reviews key policies and measures addressing these challenges, such as policies on land use, sustainable transport and energy, and water management, as well as the role of multilevel governance, investment and finance.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
789;Young people are often marginalised in urban planning. This means that their needs – in terms of housing, basic services and public spaces – are not considered in urban planning policy and implementation. UN Habitat’s Youth Unit ensures creative, fun ways for young people to get involved in urban planning and influence youth-friendly urban design. Citizen participation is important for city governments to consider the needs, interests and knowledge of different stakeholders, something requiring collaborative design and participatory decision-making processes.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
790;The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development recognises that ‘sustainable urban development and management are crucial to the quality of life of our people’. The concomitant adoption of SDG 11 represents an important extension of the MDGs, which did not give specific attention to global trends of increasing urbanisation. Fifty per cent of the global population currently live in cities, and urbanisation is expected to continue over the timeframe of the SDGs. Demographic and geographical changes mean that, by 2030, it is estimated that as many as 60 per cent of all urban dwellers will be under the age of 18.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
791;Smart cities represent the future of urban development in Emerging Asia as more and more cities and countries resort to smart technologies to build more efficient and liveable urban environments, boost economic growth, foster well-being and facilitate citizen engagement. Policy makers in the region have adopted plans to develop and promote the use of technology to organise and run urban areas. Governments have also provided significant financial backing to smart city projects, acknowledging the importance of public support in this field. The development of smart cities offers significant prospects to tackle enduring issues faced by Emerging Asian cities in policy areas such as transport, the provision of public services, education, healthcare and utilities.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;
792;This chapter discusses Indonesia’s progress in greening its economy on the path to sustainable development. It examines the policy and institutional framework for sustainable growth, then reviews the use of tax policy to pursue environmental objectives and progress in removing subsidies that can encourage environmentally harmful activities. The chapter also analyses public and private investment in environment-related infrastructure, such as that for water and sanitation, waste, energy and transport, and reviews promotion of environmental technology and green innovation as a source of economic growth and jobs. The role of development co‑operation is also discussed.;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;;

829;In 2017, worldwide material consumption reached 92.1 billion tons, up from 87 billion in 2015 and a 254 per cent increase from 27 billion in 1970, with the rate of extraction accelerating every year since 2000. This reflects the increased demand for natural resources that has defined the past decades, resulting in undue burden on environmental resources. Without urgent and concerted political action, it is projected that global resource extraction could grow to 190 billion tons by 2060.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
830;Material footprint per capita has increased considerably as well: in 1990 some 8.1 tons of natural resources were used to satisfy a person’s need, while in 2015, almost 12 tons of resources were extracted per person.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
831;Well-designed national policy frameworks and instruments are necessary to enable the fundamental shift towards sustainable consumption and production patterns. In 2018, 71 countries and the European Union reported on a total of 303 policy instruments.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
832;The per capita “material footprint” of developing countries grew from 5 metric tons in 2000 to 9 metric tons in 2017, representing a significant improvement in the material standard of living. Most of the increase is attributed to a rise in the use of non-metallic minerals, pointing to growth in the areas of infrastructure and construction.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
833;For all types of materials, developed countries have at least double the per capita footprint of developing countries. In particular, the material footprint for fossil fuels is more than four times higher for developed than developing countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
834;By 2018, a total of 108 countries had national policies and initiatives relevant to sustainable consumption and production.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
835;Decoupling economic growth from natural resource use is fundamental to sustainable development. Global figures, however, point to worsening trends: domestic material consumption (the total amount of natural resour ces used in economic processes) increased from 1.2 kg to 1.3 kg per unit of GDP from 2000 to 2010. Total domestic material consumption also rose during the same period — from 48.7 billion tons to 71.0 billion tons. The increase is due in part to rising natural resource use worldwide, in particular in Eastern Asia.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
836;Two measures, material footprint and domestic material consumption, provide an accounting of global material extraction and use, as well as flows or consumption of materials in countries. The material footprint reflects the amount of primary materials required to meet a country’s needs. It is an indicator of the material standard of living or level of capitalization of an economy. Domestic material consumption measures the amount of natural resources used in economic processes.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
837;Economic growth and development require the production of goods and services that improve the quality of life. Sustainable growth and development require minimizing the natural resources and toxic materials used, and the waste and pollutants generated, throughout the entire production and consumption process.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
838;Domestic material consumption in developed regions has diminished slightly, from 17.5 tonnes per capita in 2000 to 15.3 tonnes per capita in 2010. It remains significantly higher than the value for developing regions, which stood at 8.9 tonnes per capita in 2010. Domestic material consumption per capita increased in almost all developing regions from 2000 to 2010, except in Africa, where it remained relatively stable (around 4 tonnes per capita), and Oceania, where it decreased from around 10.7 to 7.7 tonnes per capita. The rise in domestic material consumption per capita in Asia during that period is primarily a result of rapid industrialization.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
839;"Consumerism is a social and economic order that encourages an acquisition of goods and services in ever-increasing amounts. With the industrial revolution, but particularly in the 20th century, mass production led to overproduction—the supply of goods would grow beyond consumer demand, and so manufacturers turned to planned obsolescence and advertising to manipulate consumer spending. In 1899, a book on consumerism published by Thorstein Veblen, called The Theory of the Leisure Class, examined the widespread values and economic institutions emerging along with the widespread ""leisure time"" in the beginning of the 20th century. In it Veblen ""views the activities and spending habits of this leisure class in terms of conspicuous and vicarious consumption and waste. Both are related to the display of status and not to functionality or usefulness.""In economics, consumerism may refer to economic policies which emphasise consumption. In an abstract sense, it is the consideration that the free choice of consumers should strongly orient the choice by manufacturers of what is produced and how, and therefore orient the economic organization of a society (compare producerism, especially in the British sense of the term). In this sense, consumerism expresses the idea not of ""one man, one voice"", but of ""one dollar, one voice"", which may or may not reflect the contribution of people to society.\n\nIn the almost complete absence of other sustained macro-political and social narratives, concern about global climate change notwithstanding, the pursuit of the \'good life\' through practices of what is known as \'consumerism\' has become one of the dominant global social forces, cutting across differences of religion, class, gender, ethnicity and nationality. It is the other side of the dominant ideology of market globalism and is central to what Manfred Steger calls the \'global imaginary\";;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
840;Production is a process of combining various material inputs and immaterial inputs (plans, know-how) in order to make something for consumption (output). It is the act of creating an output, a good or service which has value and contributes to the utility of individuals. The area of economics that focuses on production is referred to as production theory, which in many respects is similar to the consumption (or consumer) theory in economics.Economic well-being is created in a production process, meaning all economic activities that aim directly or indirectly to satisfy human wants and needs. The degree to which the needs are satisfied is often accepted as a measure of economic well-being. In production there are two features which explain increasing economic well-being. They are improving quality-price-ratio of goods and services and increasing incomes from growing and more efficient market production or total production which help in increasing GDP.\nThe most important forms of production are:\n\nmarket production\npublic production\nhousehold productionIn order to understand the origin of economic well-being, we must understand these three production processes. All of them produce commodities which have value and contribute to well-being of individuals.\nThe satisfaction of needs originates from the use of the commodities which are produced. The need satisfaction increases when the quality-price-ratio of the commodities improves and more satisfaction is achieved at less cost. Improving the quality-price-ratio of commodities is to a producer an essential way to improve the competitiveness of products but this kind of gains distributed to customers cannot be measured with production data. Improving the competitiveness of products means often to the producer lower product prices and therefore losses in incomes which are to be compensated with the growth of sales volume.\nEconomic well-being also increases due to the growth of incomes that are gained from the growing and more efficient market production. Market production is the only production form which creates and distributes incomes to stakeholders. Public production and household production are financed by the incomes generated in market production. Thus market production has a double role in creating well-being, i.e. the role of producing goods and services and the role of creating income. Because of this double role market production is the “primus motor” of economic well-being and therefore here under review;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
841;Goal 12 of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development aims to ensure sustainable consumption and production (SCP) patterns in communities, countries and regions of the world for development while safeguarding the environment that we live in. The key principles underpinning SCP patterns include:;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
842;Consumption and production patterns shape resource use management and related social and environmental impacts, thereby affecting sustainability. Sustainable production uses fewer resources for the same value of economic output, and sustainable consumption reduces the need for excessive resource extraction. Over the first decade of this century, however, the material footprint, which measures the amount of raw material extracted to meet consumption demand, increased globally, as did the amount of material used in production processes. Achieving this Goal requires strong national frameworks for sustainable consumption and production that are integrated into national and sectoral plans, along with sustainable business practices and consumer behaviour. Finally, it requires adherence to international norms related to hazardous chemicals and wastes.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
843;How societies use and manage their natural resources fundamentally shapes their quality of life. One of the core objectives of the 2030 Agenda is to decouple economic growth from resource use and environmental degradation, notably through improved resource efficiency, while improving people’s well-being. This can occur through a shift towards more sustainable consumption and production patterns. Such a shift requires national public policies that create conducive environments, social and physical infrastructure and markets, and a transformation of business practices along global value chains.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
844;Sustainable consumption and production refers to “the use of services and related products, which respond to basic needs and bring a better quality of life while minimizing the use of natural resources and toxic materials as well as the emissions of waste and pollutants over the life cycle of the service or product so as not to jeopardize the needs of future generations.” Consumption and production patterns that are more sustainable than is currently the case would result in a reduction in adverse environmental impacts and contribute towards poverty eradication without undermining the basis of human development through opportunities such as creation of new markets, green and decent jobs, and more efficient management of natural resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
845;Economic and social progress over the last century has been accompanied by environmental degradation that is endangering the very systems on which our future development—indeed, our very survival—depends. Globally, we continue to use ever-increasing amounts of natural resources to support our economic activity. The efficiency with which such resources are used remains unchanged at the global level, thus we have not yet seen a decoupling of economic growth and natural resource use. Globally, the generation of waste is mounting. About one third of the food produced for human consumption each year is lost or wasted, most of it in developed countries. Urgent action is needed to ensure that current material needs do not lead to over-extraction of resources and further degradation of the environment. Policies must be embraced to improve resource efficiency, reduce waste and mainstream sustainability practices across all sectors of the economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
846;Reducing food loss and waste is enshrined in SDG 12 on sustainable consumption and production – specifically in Target 12.3, which calls for the halving of food waste and reduction of food losses by 2030. It is also connected to the environmental dimension of the other SDGs, including SDG 6 on water and sanitation (Target 6.4 on the efficiency of water use), SDG 13 on climate action (Target 13.2 on the reduction of GHG emissions), SDG 14 on marine resources (Target 14.2 on protecting marine and coastal ecosystems) and SDG 15 on life on land (Target 15.1 on the conservation of ecosystems). The inclusion of food loss and waste reduction in the SDGs ref lects the fact that producing food that is not eaten – whether lost in the field or wasted on a plate – not only diminishes the quantit y of food available, but also constitutes a waste of economic and environmental resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
847;Earlier chapters of this report discussed the motives of private actors for investing in food loss or waste reduction (the business case), as well as the rationale for public intervention. The argument has been made that public interventions may be justified by the economy-wide efficiency gains to be had from loss or waste reduction (the economic case), as well as its potential contribution to improved food security and nutrition or environmental sustainability. This chapter discusses the types of public interventions that can reduce food losses or waste, not as a goal in themselves but rather as a means towards wider social or environmental goals. The scarcity of reliable data as to how much and where food is lost or wasted, and the lack of information regarding the costs of reduction efforts, are a major obstacle to the formulation of effective policies for loss or waste reduction. The chapter therefore also presents a possible road map for the collection of reliable, comparable data worldwide.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
848;This chapter discusses major developments in waste management, including the development of waste management plans at different scales. It reviews the state of production, collection and disposal of waste and discusses related information measures (or lack thereof). It presents regulatory frameworks for municipal, industrial and hazardous waste management. The chapter also presents trends in the use of chemicals and points to the lack of specific policies and plans for chemicals. It reviews the chemicals risk management policy and import measures. Finally, it discusses mercury releases from small-scale mining.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
849;Hungary has improved its waste and material management by increasing recycling and recovery. However, its efforts to foster the transition to a circular economy have so far been limited. This chapter provides an overview of trends in material consumption and waste management, as well as related policy and institutional frameworks. It discusses the country’s main objectives for waste and material management over the last decade and assesses performance in these areas. The chapter also examines Hungary’s progress in promoting a circular economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
850;The inclusion of food loss and waste reduction in the SDGs has drawn widespread international attention to this problem and has led to enhanced efforts towards reduction. It has been prioritized as a means towards inclusive and sustainable food systems, especially through improvements in environmental sustainability and food security and nutrition.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
851;This chapter examines to what extent the private sector can be relied on to reduce food loss or waste, and the scope for public-sector intervention. Where the benefits of food loss and waste reductions accrue to stakeholders other than those implementing the reduction measures, public intervention may be justified. The chapter looks at the net benefits of food loss and waste reduction for private actors (the business case) and then discusses the broad economic benefits of these reductions for society as a whole (the economic case). The economic case looks beyond the business case for food loss and waste reduction, to possible gains for society at large that private actors do not take into account. If these society-wide gains exceed the costs of efforts towards loss and waste reduction, public intervention may be justified.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
852;Korea is a good performer in waste management and is now seeking to move further towards a circular economy approach. This chapter examines trends in materials use and waste generation, as well as related policies, objectives, and legal and institutional frameworks. It looks at the instruments Korea uses to encourage waste prevention and reduction and to promote recycling and related markets. It studies the environmental effectiveness of Korea’s waste disposal and management before focusing on food waste, waste electrical and electronic equipment, and construction waste. The chapter also discusses engagement in international co-operation and outreach.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
853;The transition towards a more resource efficient and circular economy has broad linkages with international trade through the emergence of global value chains as well as trade in second-hand goods, end-of-life products, secondary materials and waste. Despite of the potential linkages between trade and the circular economy, the existing research on this issue is limited to date. For this reason, this paper highlights the potential interaction of international trade and the circular economy in order to map out potential issues to address and to guide further research areas to explore on this topic. The paper first briefly introduces the circular economy concept and how trade can come into play, second highlights the various ways in which trade and the circular economy can potentially interact with one another, and third briefly concludes with potential ways forward and next steps.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
854;Money matters in waste management, so a particular focus of the GWMO is waste management financing. After providing a summary of the key messages (5.1), this chapter seeks to understand the costs and benefits, including the difficulty of quantifying the costs of inaction (5.2) and the less tangible benefits to society of good waste and resource management. After introducing waste and resource management as both a public service and a business (5.3), a generic financing model is introduced (5.4) and applied to business-to-business waste services (5.5). The next three sections then apply the financing model to municipal solid waste management, looking in turn at the available options for service delivery (5.6), revenue collection (5.7) and investment finance (5.8). Finally, a discussion on how to decide on the appropriate financing model in a particular situation provides a ‘toolkit’ to serve as a basis for action (5.9).;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
855;This paper reviews the existing literature on modelling the macroeconomic consequences of the transition to a circular economy. It provides insights into the current state of the art on modelling policies to improve resource efficiency and the transition to a circular economy by examining 24 modelling-based assessments of a circular economy transition.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
856;This chapter presents an overview of the plastics recycling industry. It begins with an overview of the recycled plastics value chain, from initial waste collection and sorting activities through to the production of recycled plastics suitable for re-introduction into the economy. The second part of the chapter then looks at each stage of the value chain in more detail. The market structure associated with plastics waste collection, sorting, and reprocessing is described along with the key actors and technologies involved in each of these activities;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
857;Estonia has successfully undertaken a major transition in municipal solid waste management, from heavy reliance on landfilling to energy recovery through incineration. However, it is unlikely to reach its recycling targets, and managing high volumes of hazardous waste from combustion and processing of oil shale remains an important challenge. This chapter provides an overview of trends in waste generation and material consumption, related policy and institutional frameworks, and analyses Estonia’s policies for managing major waste streams and its steps in promoting a circular economy.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
858;ESCAP began developing the IRRC model across the Asia–Pacific region in 2007 after a regional assessment of viable low-cost and low-technology solid waste management practices that can thrive in unique conditions cited it as exemplary. Having been conceived, tested and refined in Dhaka, the IRRC approach was found to be robustly suited to the realities of low and middle-income cities.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
859;The conventional “grow first, clean up later” approaches to economic growth are increasingly placing the futures of regional economies and societies at risk. The forward-thinking policymaker is tasked to promote development based on eco-efficient economic growth and at the same time, record more inclusive gains in human welfare and socio-economic progress. In order to assist policymakers in responding to such challenges, ESCAP’s “Greening of economic growth” series provides quick access to easy-to-read guidance to specific policy tools.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
860;For many countries, tourism provides a significant source of foreign exchange and foreign direct investment. If managed sustainably, tourism can make an important contribution towards conserving natural and cultural heritage resources, generating and distributing wealth equitably, empowering the disadvantaged, generating jobs and supporting infrastructure development. This guidance document, entitled “Responsible Food Purchasing: Four Steps Towards Sustainability for the Hospitality Sector”, will help food purchasers to understand better the importance to their business of responsible food purchasing, while providing practical advice and guidance to enable them to make the right decisions and choices. This guidance outlines an approach to integrating food sustainability into your business, with practical steps, checklists and tips reinforced by case studies that provide valuable learning from those already embarked on responsible food purchasing. The resources listed at the end of the document will enable you to explore the wider sustainability agenda further, as responsible food purchasing remains a rapidly evolving field.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
861;The transition to Circular Economy necessitates right incentives for choosing products and services with lower environmental impacts, in the form of price signals and sufficient environmental information. An ecolabel indicates that the product is, environmentally speaking, among the best products available on the market and thus has the role to steer stepwise developments towards sustainability. The Swan criteria promote quality products with requirements on durability and the use of secondary raw materials. To further align the criteria with Circular Economy, future criteria development might focus more on aspects including upgradability, reparability, multi-functionality, component reuse and innovative forms of consumption and production. This report was prepared as part of a Nordic project, and the results could be useful in the development of the Nordic Ecolabel in the future.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
862;This chapter presents the current status of recycling of CRMs in the target end-of life products, identifies the key bottlenecks of recycling (and reuse) of the selected products, and briefly describes their reasons and impacts. Bottlenecks are defined as factors that limit the performance and efficiency of recycling or reuse of the products and thus prevent or limit the move towards a near zero-waste value chain and circular economy. The bottleneck analysis of ELV and WEEE sectors carried out as a part of the European project NEW_InnoNet (http://www.newinnonet.eu/) (NEW_InnoNet D2.5 by Bachér et al. 2016) has been utilized as a basis. In addition, literature describing the bottlenecks of recycling of lighting products and batteries has been reviewed. The bottlenecks identified by experts in the project workshop have also been considered, especially in Sections 4.1.2 and 4.3.2;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
863;Actors from all parts of the textile value chain are showing an ambition to make the textile value chain more circular and resource efficient. Starting with a limited number of frontrunners using recycled textile fibres, the issue of textile-to-textile recycling is beginning to pervade an increasing number of brands’ strategic discussions and decisions.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
864;This chapter examines Colombia’s policy and institutional framework for chemicals management. It reviews the framework for testing, assessing and managing the risks associated with chemicals, and for disseminating the related information. This includes provisions for chemical accident prevention, preparedness and response. The chapter also examines Colombia’s progress in managing specific chemicals, such as ozone-depleting substances, persistent organic pollutants and mercury, and reviews its participation in international co-operation in chemicals management.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;
865;Page 1 of 7 2018 HLPF Review of SDGs implementation: SDG 12 - Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns Status of Progress on SDG 12 Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 12 “Ensure sustainable consumption and production patterns” has achieved some progress to date, but significant gaps remain, and implementation efforts have so far been seriously under-resourced. Overall, the development of national policy on sustainable consumption and production patterns (SCP) indicates overarching positive trends, as demonstrated by the fact that, since 2002, the number of such policies and instruments has almost continuously increased. As shown in reporting on SDG indicator 12.1.1, in 2018, undertaken by the 10YFP Secretariat, 71 countries plus the European Union have documented their macro- policies, regulatory, voluntary or economic instruments that support the shift towards SCP.;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;;

891;13.b Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing States, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
892;Increasing greenhouse gas emissions are driving climate change. In 2017, greenhouse gas concentrations reached new highs, with globally averaged mole fractions of CO2 at 405.5 parts per million (ppm), up from 400.1 ppm in 2015, and at 146 per cent of pre-industrial levels. Moving towards 2030 emission objectives compatible with the 2°C and 1.5°C pathways requires a peak to be achieved as soon as possible, followed by rapid reductions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
893;As indicated under Sustainable Development Goal 1 (see para. 22 above), during the period 1998–2017, direct economic losses from disasters were estimated at almost $3 trillion. Climate-related and geophysical disasters claimed an estimated 1.3 million lives.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
894;As of April 2019, 185 parties had ratified the Paris Agreement. Parties to the Paris Agreement are expected to prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions, and 183 parties had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, while 1 party had communicated its second. Under the Agreement, all parties are required to submit new nationally determined contributions, containing revised and much more ambitious targets, by 2020.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
895;As of 9 April 2018, 175 Parties had ratified the Paris Agreement and 168 Parties (167 countries plus the European Commission) had communicated their first nationally determined contributions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change Secretariat.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
896;In addition, as of 9 April 2018, 10 developing countries had successfully completed and submitted the first iteration of their national adaptation plans for responding to climate change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
897;The number of deaths attributed to natural disasters continues to rise, despite progress in implementing disaster risk reduction strategies. From 1990 to 2015, more than 1.6 million people died in internationally reported natural disasters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
898;Many countries have begun implementing national and local disaster risk reduction strategies. In 2014-2015, most reporting countries indicated that environmental impact assessments, legislation on protected areas, climate change adaptation projects and programmes, and integrated planning played a major role in reducing underlying risk factors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
899;The global nature of climate change calls for broad international cooperation in building resilience and adaptive capacity to its adverse effects, developing sustainable low-carbon pathways to the future, and accelerating the reduction of global greenhouse gas emissions. On 22 April 2016, 175 Member States signed the Paris Agreement under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change. The new agreement aims to reduce the pace of climate change and to accelerate and intensify the actions and investments needed for a sustainable low-carbon future.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
900;Climate change often exacerbates disasters. Between 1990 and 2013, more than 1.6 million people died in internationally reported disasters, with annual deaths trending upwards. As a result, more countries are acting on the imperative to implement national and local disaster risk reduction strategies. In 2015, 83 countries had legislative and/or regulatory provisions in place for managing disaster risk.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
901;Climate change is already affecting the most vulnerable countries and populations, in particular the least developed countries and the small island developing States. The preparation of national adaptation programmes of action under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change is helping the least developed countries address urgent and immediate needs, with support from the Least Developed Countries Fund and the Least Developed Countries Expert Group. In addition, the implementation of national adaptation programmes of action will help the least developed countries prepare and seek funding for comprehensive national adaptation plans, thereby reducing their risk of being left behind.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
902;"Climate is the long-term average of weather, typically averaged over a period of 30 years. Some of the meteorological variables that are commonly measured are temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, and precipitation. In a broader sense, climate is the state of the components of the climate system, which includes the ocean and ice on Earth. The climate of a location is affected by its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as well as nearby water bodies and their currents.\nMore generally, the ""climate"" of a region is the general state of the climate system at that location at the current time.\nClimates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was the Köppen climate classification. The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and how climate change affects it. The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region.\nPaleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates. Since very few direct observations of climate are available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred from proxy variables that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in lake beds and ice cores, and biotic evidence such as tree rings and coral. Climate models are mathematical models of past, present and future climates. Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of factors; recent warming is discussed in global warming. Global warming results in redistributions. For example, ""a 3°C change in mean annual temperature corresponds to a shift in isotherms of approximately 300–400 km in latitude (in the temperate zone) or 500 m in elevation. Therefore, species are expected to move upwards in elevation or towards the poles in latitude in response to shifting climate zones""";;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
903;Over the last few decades, natural and human-induced disasters have become more frequent and destructive, with small-scale fishers and fishing communities becoming more and more vulnerable to the risk of disasters, and consequently suffering serious disaster-related losses of life and property (FAO, 2007a). Global impacts of climate change are increasingly being felt, with communities dependent on fisheries and rain-fed agriculture possibly the most vulnerable to climate change impacts (Yap, 2011). Within such communities, however, the impacts of disaster are not evenly distributed. Women and girls are more likely to be negatively affected than are men, and face greater barriers to reducing their vulnerabilities and coping with the effects of disasters (UN Women, 2015).;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
904;This glossary lists the most important terms used in this guide but it is not intended to give a complete list of terms related to disaster risk management and climate change adaptation. For a full overview, please consult the respective references.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
905;The aim of this article is to assess the efficacy of the Paris Agreement to generate policies and incentivize actions that can contribute to halt climate change significantly. The article shows that the agreement in many ways represents a significant shift in global climate politics. By making domestically driven climate policy central to the treaty, the Paris Agreement avoids some of the reasons for multilateral gridlock that permeated global climate policy for decades. The biggest challenge for state and non-state actors is to increase ambition in climate commitments. The article concludes with recommendations on how to accelerate climate action.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
906;Climate change and its effects on human, animal and plant life is arguably one of the most pressing challenges currently facing humanity. Developing countries, specifically those dependent on commodities, are particularly vulnerable to climate change, but also, the commodities they produce affect the climate. On the one hand, extreme weather patterns such as heatwaves, floods, hurricanes and frequent seasonal abnormalities have been adversely affecting crop yields and fish production, and destroying infrastructure in the mining sector. On the other hand, clearance of forests for agricultural expansion, including rearing of livestock, and for mining and drilling projects for the extraction and use of fossil fuels, are the greatest sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions that are largely responsible for climate change.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
907;Climate change is already having a profound and alarming impact worldwide. Global temperatures continued to increase in 2016, setting a new record of about 1.1 degrees centigrade above the pre-industrial period. The extent of global sea ice fell to 4.14 million square kilometres in 2016, the second lowest on record. Atmospheric CO2 levels reached 400 parts per million. Drought conditions predominated across much of the globe, influenced by the El Niño phenomenon. In addition to rising sea levels and global temperatures, extreme weather events are becoming more common and natural habitats such as coral reefs are declining. These changes affect people everywhere, but disproportionately harm the poorest and the most vulnerable. Concerted action is urgently needed to stem climate change and strengthen resilience to pervasive and ever-increasing climaterelated hazards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
908;While the traditional DRR strategy has been on prevention, search and rescue, and ‘building back better’, it is clear that more attention needs to be given to focus research and resources on the impact of the aftermath of disasters. This chapter examines the nature of disaster risk, and offers fresh analysis and recommendations for action with special reference to small and island states, to avert and mitigate the wide-ranging service implications of the aftershocks of disasters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
909;This chapter looks at the relationship between climate change and gender in Commonwealth countries. The relationship is not simply a one-way relationship, with climate change impacting on different sexes in different ways or, more specifically, having a greater negative impact on women and girls than men and boys. The association between gender and climate change also encompasses the impact that women have had to date in shaping climate change policies at the subnational, national and international levels.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
910;This chapter argues that approaching climate change mitigation through a well-being lens can help countries identify and implement measures to reverse rising greenhouse gas emissions, avoid lock-in of carbon-intensive technologies and reduce long-lived carbon dioxide emissions to zero on a net basis by the middle of the 21st century, or shortly thereafter. The implications of this approach are likely to differ across jurisdictions, reflecting their levels of development and the particular challenges and opportunities they face. Adopting and adapting a well-being approach will put governments in a better position to reach their climate and broader well-being goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
911;Climate change and development are fundamentally interconnected. Hard won development gains will be lost without rapid, coherent action to address the climate crisis and transition to low-emissions, climate‑resilient pathways.This chapter first explores how and why the climate crisis is closely interconnected with development, and looks at potential scenarios for development as the world heats up. It then looks at how aligning development co‑operation with the objectives of the Paris Agreement will bring opportunities to advance development while supporting the transition to low-emissions, climate-resilient pathways.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
912;The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is a universal instrument that recognizes the importance of the contribution of all countries to achieving the goal of sustainable development, including through support to developing countries, particularly the most vulnerable among them. As discussed in chapter I of the present Survey, a significant component of the vulnerability of many developing countries, in particular low-income countries, is associated with their exposure and susceptibility to climate hazards. Left unattended, this vulnerability will make it difficult to achieve climate resilience as well as other development goals, especially those related to poverty and inequality reduction, food security, and improved nutrition and health.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
913;"Climate change will affect all types of infrastructure, including energy, transport and water. Rising temperatures, increased flood risk and other potential hazards will threaten the reliable and efficient operation of these networks, with potentially large economic and social impacts. Decisions made now about the design, location and operation of infrastructure will determine how resilient they will be to a changing climate.
This paper provides a framework for action aimed at national policymakers in OECD countries to help them ensure new and existing infrastructure is resilient to climate change. It examines national governments’ action in OECD countries, and provides recent insights from professional and industry associations, development banks and other financial institutions on how to make infrastructure more resilient to climate change.";;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
914;An enhanced transparency framework will be a central component of the post-2020 international climate policy regime under the Paris Agreement. This paper explores the issue of transparency of climate finance information in the context of climate finance goals under the United Nations’ Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). The transparency framework of the Paris Agreement covers only a subset of climate finance, i.e. finance provided and mobilised by developed countries for developing countries, climate finance provided and mobilised by “other” countries for developing countries, as well as climate finance received by developing countries. This paper focuses on data collection, reporting and review of these elements, and explores how the transparency of information on climate finance provided and mobilised could be improved from current arrangements in order to meet the aims set out in the Paris Agreement.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
915;As greenhouse gas levels continue to climb, climate change is occurring much faster than anticipated, and its effects are evident worldwide. The global mean temperature for 2018 was approximately 1°C above the pre-industrial baseline, and the last four years have been the warmest on record. Sea levels continue to rise at an accelerating rate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
916;Natural disasters continue to cause widespread damage and losses, with fast growing economies particularly exposed. Governments often shoulder a significant share of the costs of disaster recovery and reconstruction. This is true in OECD countries and even more so in developing economies, where private insurance markets are not as well developed. The fiscal impact of disasters on a government’s budget can be sizeable. Expenditures for the government arise from both explicit and implicit commitments to compensate for disaster losses. This report presents the results of a study that compares country practices in the management of the financial implications of disasters on government finances for a set of OECD member and partner countries particularly exposed to natural hazards.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
917;Current national commitments to reduce GHG emissions and otherwise mitigate global warming under the Paris Agreement will not contain global warming within 2°C above pre-industrial levels, let alone the preferred containment within 1.5°C. The IPCC SR1.5 projects that, based on Member States’ current NDCs, the climate system is heading off track into the territory of 2.9°C to 3.4°C warming.317 If this happens, it would take future hydrometeorological hazard extremes well outside the known range of current experience and alter the loss and damage equations and fragility curves of almost all known human and natural systems, placing them at unknown levels of risk. This would render current strategies for CCA and DRR, in most countries, virtually obsolete. It also means that it is no longer sufficient to address adaptation in isolation from development planning, and that sustainable socioeconomic development, by definition, must include mitigation of global warming.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
918;"The Paris Agreement states that all countries should strive to formulate and communicate long-term low greenhouse gas emission development strategies (LT-LEDS) and the Paris Agreement’s accompanying decision invites countries to communicate a LT-LEDS by 2020. LT-LEDS are a fundamental tool available to countries to envision low-emission development in alignment with broader sustainability, socio-economic and climate change adaptation goals. This document aims to support countries’ efforts in the development of LT-LEDS, as it provides points of reflection for the establishment of an effective process for developing LT-LEDS. The document discusses potential elements to be included in a LT-LEDS; identifies and explores potential linkages between Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and LT-LEDS; examines governance options for setting up a LT-LEDS process and analyses countries’ experience to date in developing LT-LEDS. The paper also provides a set of guiding questions useful for the development of LT-LEDS.";;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
919;A wide gap remains between today’s world and a world in which the energy system underpinning economic activity is compatible with global goals for climate protection, energy access and clean air. The rise in living standards over the past century has relied heavily on the depletion of the world’s natural resources and the burning of fossil fuels to power growth. This economic model is clearly no longer viable, as evidenced by the accelerating pace of environmental degradation, rising greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, and the increasing intensity and frequency of extreme weather events.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
920;Farmers will undertake many adaptation actions to meet changing climate conditions and will often do so without any government intervention. However, when such actions provide both private and public benefits, the public sector may play a role in how these are developed. This report aims to establish a framework to help identify specific actions that governments could take in this respect and that could avoid sending signals leading to non-adaptation or maladaptation. This report begins with a review of national adaptation strategies for the agricultural sector in OECD countries and highlights different approaches undertaken by governments. It then identifies the main criteria under which governments may take action to increase the resilience of the agricultural sector and its adaptive capacity to climate change. Finally, it discusses strategies to monitor and evaluate adaptation policies;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
921;"Enhancing “readiness” of the countries of Eastern Europe, the Caucasus and Central Asia (EECCA) to access scaled-up international climate finance is essential to accelerate their transition towards low-carbon and climate-resilient economies. This chapter explores ways in which the EECCA countries and their partners can first assess the countries’ readiness to access climate finance, and then identify possible areas for improvement. Based on the review of existing climate finance readiness programmes implemented by several development co-operation partners, this chapter outlines key questions to assess the EECCA countries’ climate finance readiness. These questions fall into the following four categories: (a) planning targets, strategies and policies; (b) building institutional capacities; (c) developing programmes and projects; and (d) implementing, monitoring, evaluating and learning.";;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
922;Climate change presents the single biggest threat to development, and its widespread, unprecedented effects disproportionately burden the poorest and the most vulnerable. Goal 13 calls for urgent action not only to combat climate change and its impacts, but also to build resilience in responding to climate-related hazards and natural disasters.;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;
923;The Paris Agreement presents a historical landmark in the global response to climate change and sets out the objective of limiting global warming to well below 2 °C and pursuing efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 °C above pre-industrial levels. However, the national climate change efforts to which Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) have committed themselves in the form of Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) are largely insufficient, and only cover one third of the greenhouse gas emissions reductions necessary to reach this temperature goal (UNEP 2017). There is still a significant gap between 2030 emission levels and a least-cost 2 °C pathway amounting to 11 GtCO2e or even as much as 13.5 GtCO2e, taking only unconditional NDCs into account (UNEP 2017). Global greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, albeit at a slower rate, and even though the Parties must increase the goals of their NDCs over time, it is unlikely that the emissions reductions thus achieved will be sufficient (UNEP 2017).;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;;

955;Ocean acidification is caused by the uptake of atmospheric CO2 by the ocean, which changes the chemical composition of the seawater. Long-term observations of ocean acidification over the past 30 years have shown an average increase of acidity of 26 per cent since pre-industrial times, and at this rate, an increase of 100 to 150 per cent is predicted by the end of the century, with serious consequences for marine life.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
956;To achieve sustainable development of fisheries, fish stocks must be maintained at a biologically sustainable level. Analyses reveal that the fraction of world marine fish stocks that are within biologically sustainable levels declined from 90 per cent in 1974 to 66.9 per cent in 2015.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
957;As of December 2018, over 24 million km2 (17.2 per cent) of waters under national jurisdiction (0–200 nautical miles from a national border) were covered by protected areas, a significant increase from 12 per cent in 2015 and more than double the extent covered in 2010. The global mean percentage of each marine key biodiversity area covered by protected areas increased from 31.2 per cent in 2000 to 44.7 per cent in 2015 and to 45.7 per cent in 2018.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
958;Illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing remains one of the greatest threats to sustainable fisheries, the livelihoods of those who depend upon them and marine ecosystems. A framework of international instruments has been developed that addresses different aspects of fisheries management. Most countries have taken measures to combat such fishing and have adopted an increasing number of fisheries management instruments in the past decade. For example, the Agreement on Port State Measures to Prevent, Deter and Eliminate Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated Fishing, the first international binding agreement to combat such fishing, entered into force in June 2016. The number of parties to the Agreement has rapidly increased and stood at 58 as of February 2019.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
959;Small-scale fisheries are present in almost all countries, accounting for more than half of total production on average, in terms of both quantity and value. To promote small-scale fishers’ access to productive resources, services and markets, most countries have developed targeted regulatory and institutional frameworks. However, more than 20 per cent of countries have a low to medium level of implementation of such frameworks, particularly in Oceania and Central and South Asia;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
960;The global share of marine fish stocks that are within biologically sustainable levels declined from 90 per cent in 1974 to 69 per cent in 2013.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
961;Studies at open ocean and coastal sites around the world show that current levels of marine acidity have increased by about 26 per cent on average since the start of the Industrial Revolution. Moreover, marine life is being exposed to conditions outside previously experienced natural variability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
962;Global trends point to continued deterioration of coastal waters due to pollution and eutrophication. Without concerted efforts, coastal eutrophication is expected to increase in 20 per cent of large marine ecosystems by 2050.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
963;Global trends point to continued deterioration of coastal waters owing to pollution and eutrophication (excessive nutrients in water, frequently a result of run-off from land, which causes dense plant growth and the death of animal life from lack of oxygen). Of the 63 large marine ecosystems evaluated under the Transboundary Waters Assessment Programme, 16 per cent of the ecosystems are in the “high” or “highest” risk categories for coastal eutrophication. They are located mainly in Western Europe, Southern and Eastern Asia, and the Gulf of Mexico.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
964;Ocean acidification is closely linked to shifts in the carbonate chemistry of the waters, which can lead to a significant weakening of the shells and skeletons of many marine species (such as reef-building corals and shelled molluscs).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
965;A nautical mile is a unit of measurement used in air, marine, and space navigation, and for the definition of territorial waters. Historically, it was defined as one minute (1/60 of a degree) of latitude along any line of longitude. Today the international nautical mile is defined as exactly 1852 metres (about 1.15 miles). The derived unit of speed is the knot, one nautical mile per hour;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
966;Maritime history is the study of human interaction with and activity at sea. It covers a broad thematic element of history that often uses a global approach, although national and regional histories remain predominant. As an academic subject, it often crosses the boundaries of standard disciplines, focusing on understanding humankind's various relationships to the oceans, seas, and major waterways of the globe. Nautical history records and interprets past events involving ships, shipping, navigation, and seafarers.Maritime history is the broad overarching subject that includes fishing, whaling, international maritime law, naval history, the history of ships, ship design, shipbuilding, the history of navigation, the history of the various maritime-related sciences (oceanography, cartography, hydrography, etc.), sea exploration, maritime economics and trade, shipping, yachting, seaside resorts, the history of lighthouses and aids to navigation, maritime themes in literature, maritime themes in art, the social history of sailors and passengers and sea-related communities.  There are a number of approaches to the field, sometimes divided into two broad categories: Traditionalists, who seek to engage a small audience of other academics, and Utilitarians, who seek to influence policy makers and a wider audience.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
967;Marine debris, also known as marine litter, is human-created waste that has deliberately or accidentally been released in a sea or ocean. Floating oceanic debris tends to accumulate at the center of gyres and on coastlines, frequently washing aground, when it is known as beach litter or tidewrack. Deliberate disposal of wastes at sea is called ocean dumping. Naturally occurring debris, such as driftwood, are also present.\nWith the increasing use of plastic, human influence has become an issue as many types of (petrochemical) plastics do not biodegrade. Waterborne plastic poses a serious threat to fish, seabirds, marine reptiles, and marine mammals, as well as to boats and coasts. Dumping, container spillages, litter washed into storm drains and waterways and wind-blown landfill waste all contribute to this problem.\nIn efforts to prevent and mediate marine debris and pollutants, laws and policies have been adopted internationally. Depending on relevance to the issues and various levels of contribution, some countries have introduced more specified protection policies;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
968;Marine pollution occurs when harmful effects result from the entry into the ocean of chemicals, particles, industrial, agricultural and residential waste, noise, or the spread of invasive organisms. Eighty percent of marine pollution comes from land. Air pollution is also a contributing factor by carrying off pesticides or dirt into the ocean. Land and air pollution have proven to be harmful to marine life and its habitats.The pollution often comes from nonpoint sources such as agricultural runoff, wind-blown debris, and dust. Pollution in large bodies of water can be aggravated by physical phenomena like the biological effects of Langmuir circulation. Nutrient pollution, a form of water pollution, refers to contamination by excessive inputs of nutrients. It is a primary cause of eutrophication of surface waters, in which excess nutrients, usually nitrates or phosphates, stimulate algae growth. Many potentially toxic chemicals adhere to tiny particles which are then taken up by plankton and benthic animals, most of which are either deposit feeders or filter feeders. In this way, the toxins are concentrated upward within ocean food chains. Many particles combine chemically in a manner highly depletive of oxygen, causing estuaries to become anoxic.\nWhen pesticides are incorporated into the marine ecosystem, they quickly become absorbed into marine food webs. Once in the food webs, these pesticides can cause mutations, as well as diseases, which can be harmful to humans as well as the entire food web. Toxic metals can also be introduced into marine food webs. These can cause a change to tissue matter, biochemistry, behaviour, reproduction, and suppress growth in marine life. Also, many animal feeds have a high fish meal or fish hydrolysate content. In this way, marine toxins can be transferred to land animals, and appear later in meat and dairy products.\nIn order to protect the ocean from marine pollution, policies have been developed internationally. There are different ways for the ocean to get polluted, therefore there have been multiple laws, policies, and treaties put into place throughout history.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
969;Marine life, or sea life or ocean life, is the plants, animals and other organisms that live in the salt water of the sea or ocean, or the brackish water of coastal estuaries. At a fundamental level, marine life affects the nature of the planet. Marine organisms produce oxygen and sequester carbon. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land. The term marine comes from the Latin mare, meaning sea or ocean.\nMost life forms evolved initially in marine habitats. By volume, oceans provide about 90 percent of the living space on the planet. The earliest vertebrates appeared in the form of fish, which live exclusively in water. Some of these evolved into amphibians which spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Other fish evolved into land mammals and subsequently returned to the ocean as seals, dolphins or whales. Plant forms such as kelp and algae grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. Plankton forms the general foundation of the ocean food chain, particularly the phytoplankton which are key primary producers.\nMarine invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters, including breathing tubes as in mollusc siphons. Fish have gills instead of lungs, although some species of fish, such as the lungfish, have both. Marine mammals, such as dolphins, whales, otters, and seals need to surface periodically to breathe air.\nThere are over 200,000 documented marine species with perhaps two million marine species yet to be documented. Marine species range in size from the microscopic, including phytoplankton which can be as small as 0.02 micrometres, to huge cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises), including the blue whale – the largest known animal reaching 33 metres (108 ft) in length. Marine microorganisms, including protists, bacteria and viruses, constitute about 70% of the total marine biomass.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
970;"The coast, also known as the coastline or seashore, is defined as the area where land meets the sea or ocean, or as a line that forms the boundary between the land and the ocean or a lake. Around  620,000 kilometres (390,000 mi) of coastline are on Earth. Because of the coastline paradox, a coastline's exact perimeter cannot be determined. \nThe term coastal zone is used to refer to a region where interactions of sea and land processes occur. Both the terms coast and coastal are often used to describe a geographic location or region located on a coastline (e.g., New Zealand's West Coast, or the East and West Coasts of the United States).\nThe term pelagic coast refers to a coast that fronts on the open ocean, as opposed to a more sheltered coast in a gulf or bay. A shore, on the other hand, can refer to parts of land adjoining any large body of water, including oceans (seashore) and lakes (lake shore). Similarly, the somewhat related term stream bed or stream bank refers to the land alongside or sloping down to a river (riverbank) or body of water smaller than a lake. Bank is also used in some parts of the world to refer to an artificial ridge of earth intended to retain the water of a river or pond; in other places this may be called a levee.\nWhile there is general agreement in the scientific community regarding the definition of a coast, in the political sphere, the delineation of the extents of a coast differ according to jurisdiction. Government authorities in various countries may define coast differently for economic and social policy reasons. According to the UN atlas, 44% of all people live within 150 km (93 mi) of the sea";;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
971;"This paper maps interrelationships among targets of the Sustainable Development Goal dedicated to oceans (SDG 14), as well as interrelationships between those targets and other SDGs. This is done using a large number of UN reports as well as scientific publications. The literature identifies many linkages among the targets of SDG 14; most of these targets are potentially synergistic with one another. Many linkages also exist between SDG 14 targets and other SDGs. Different targets under SDG 14 link to different SDGs. This has implications for policy discussions on how to achieve progress on SDG 14. The interrelationships that we highlight can be used as a tool for dialogue between policy and scientific communities working on oceans, in particular for assessing the status of knowledge on the various linkages, as well as identifying linkages that are likely to matter most for progress on SDG 14.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
972;The Ocean is in dire need of our help. If the cycle of decline, in which it is currently caught, is allowed to continue, the deleterious impacts on the life-forms dwelling in, above and next to the Ocean may well become irreversible.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
973;This issue of Commonwealth Trade Hot Topics examines the need for special and differential treatment (S&DT) in a potential fisheries agreement at the WTO from the point of view of the socio-economic needs of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) in the Pacific region and current proposals on S&DT in fisheries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
974;Sustainable Development Goal 14, to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development, is aimed at promoting the conservation and sustainable use of marine and coastal ecosystems, preventing marine pollution and increasing the economic benefits to small island developing States and the least developed countries from the sustainable use of marine resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
975;This report evaluates the risk of vulnerable marine ecosystems (VMEs) in Arctic and sub-Arctic waters to bottom trawling. It is based on an exhaustive compilation of data on the distribution of VME indicator species, including published and unpublished data, and new data gathered during the project from areas where information is sparse. An overview of the approaches and methodologies for mapping of VME distribution is presented. Eleven VMEs are identified based on management goals for coral and sponge communities present in the study area.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
976;In 2014, the United Nations commemorated the twentieth anniversary of the entry into force of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. During the year, the Organization continued to promote universal acceptance of the Convention and its two implementing Agreements on the implementation of Part XI of the Convention and on the conservation and management of straddling fish stocks and highly migratory fish stocks, respectively.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
977;This chapter provides an overview of the mid-term strategy (2017–2020) towards the sustainability of Mediterranean and Black Sea fisheries (“mid-term strategy”), launched by the GFCM in 2016 in order to define a course of decisive action aimed at reverting the alarming trend in the status of commercially exploited stocks in its area of application. The rationale leading to the development of the mid-term strategy as well as its targets and objectives are presented, together with the progress achieved and the challenges and opportunities faced during the first phase of implementation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
978;Oceans cover almost three quarters of the planet, comprising the largest ecosystem on Earth. Large coastal populations in every region depend on them for their livelihoods and prosperity. Oceans also provide priceless environmental services: they generate half the oxygen we breathe, support a wealth of marine resources and act as a climate regulator. Yet despite their critical importance, the mounting impacts of climate change (including ocean acidification), overfishing and marine pollution are jeopardizing progress in protecting the world’s oceans. Small island developing States are the most threatened. Due to the transboundary nature of oceans, marine resource management requires interventions at all levels (national, regional and global) to mitigate threats.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
979;Although small states' total share of global trade has been declining over time, specific sectors, including those related to the ocean economy, have been experiencing growth. A number of Commonwealth coastal small states have been pioneering blue economy approaches underpinned by integrated ocean governance frameworks. This International Trade Working Paper explores the associations between improvements in ocean governance – with a focus on fisheries – and Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 14 trade-related outcomes. It draws on three Commonwealth case studies: Barbados, Belize and Seychelles. The preliminary analysis undertaken suggests that improvements in ocean governance through enhanced coastal protection could boost trade by US$3 million a year on average for Commonwealth small states. Boosting Commonwealth small states coastal protection so that it exceeds the global average could increase the value of fisheries trade for member countries by an average of US$10 million annually. These initial exploratory results provide a number of avenues for further research, including the ocean economy and trade strategies being pioneered in selected Commonwealth small states.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
980;Biodiversity has declined rapidly over the last 50 years, with severe implications for human health and well-being, societal resilience and sustainable development. This chapter summarises the international policy context for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity. Drawing on a range of data and indicators, it outlines the main pressures on biodiversity globally, and examines trends in the state of terrestrial, marine and freshwater biodiversity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
981;Small-scale fisheries are deeply rooted in the fabric of Mediterranean and Black Sea fishing communities. Their significant role in this region is well known, despite, in some cases, limited available data for this sector. Since millennia, the small-scale fishing sector has supported livelihoods within coastal communities. The role it plays in sustaining economic activity and ensuring food security within vulnerable coastal communities is not to be overlooked, particularly in the current context of ever-increasing rural to urban migration. Furthermore, SSF play a key role in maintaining local traditions and culture, creating added value for other sectors, such as the restaurant and tourism industries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
982;"This chapter provides an overview of the trends in the state of, and pressures on, marine biodiversity; the economic values associated with marine ecosystems; and the types of policy instruments that are available for the conservation and sustainable use of marine biodiversity. It then discusses the role of marine protected areas and summarises their current use and trends. Drawing on the key findings from the publication, the chapter concludes with good practice insights for more effective design and implementation of marine protected areas.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
983;Regional fisheries management organisations (RFMOs) are the primary mechanism for co-operation between fishing countries and coastal states to ensure sustainable fishing globally. This paper aims to inspire and guide RFMO secretariats and member countries in how to focus their effort and investment to step up the contribution of RFMOs to the fight against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing. It does so by measuring the extent to which RFMOs apply best practices against IUU fishing and pointing to the remaining gaps. Information gathered from RFMOs’ resolutions and recommendations introducing conservation and management measures (CMMs), other publicly available sources and direct communication with RFMOs’ secretariats was analysed and summarised into five indicators reflecting the most important management tools targeting IUU fishing at the disposal of RFMOs. Indicators show overall progress among RFMOs, but discrepancies remain, suggesting scope for improvement by learning from best performers.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
984;Oceans, seas and coastal areas form an integrated and essential component of the Earth’s ecosystem and are critical to sustainable development. They cover more than two thirds of the Earth’s surface and contain 97 per cent of the planet’s water. Oceans contribute to poverty eradication by providing opportunities for sustainable livelihoods and decent work. Over 3 billion people depend on marine and coastal resources as a means of support. In addition, oceans play a crucial role in the achievement of global food security, as well as human health and well-being. They are the primary regulator of the global climate, function as an important sink for greenhouse gases, serve as the host for huge reservoirs of biodiversity and play a major role in producing the oxygen we breathe.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
985;This chapter explores how fisheries and aquaculture policies in Indonesia can contribute to improved food security and nutrition. It takes stock of the challenges to food security in Indonesia, describes how fisheries and aquaculture contribute to nutritious food supplies and incomes, and outlines the strategy of the Government of Indonesia for the sector. Policies currently in place are then analysed, and alternative policy options are proposed, where relevant, in light of three main objectives: sustainable management of natural resources for the future, increased economic opportunities for fishers and aqua-farmers, and improved consumer access to seafood.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
986;Several countries have been setting up strategic roadmaps to support marine biotechnologies that could drive innovation and help address the global sustainability goals of food, energy, and health. The report identifies and begins to address challenges facing cooperation on marine biotechnology across countries. First, the report provides on an international definition of marine biotechnology that was developed through a multi-year process. Second, the report reviews the international infrastructure in marine biotechnology and identifies the lack of standardisation as a critical issue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
987;It was midnight on 14 December 2016, when five fishermen in Tombo village near Freetown in Sierra Leone revved up a small outboard engine and powered their boat far out to sea. They threw in their net and soon bagged a good quantity of fish. But as they hauled in their catch, a terrible storm blew in. When the waters finally calmed, one of them, an 18-year-old named Alimamy, could not be found.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
988;The discussion on improving disciplines on fisheries subsidies and making a contribution towards sustainable fishing and managing global fisheries has been ongoing at the World Trade Organization (WTO) since the WTO Doha Ministerial Conference held in 2001. In 2005, the WTO Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration gave a mandate on negotiations on fisheries subsidies aimed at strengthening disciplines on fisheries subsidies and prohibiting certain forms of subsidies that lead to overcapacity and over-fishing. Small vulnerable economies (SVEs) have strongly been involved in these discussions, particularly in view of the implications for their economies of the threat of certain forms of fisheries subsidies to the sustainability of fishing. Negotiations on fisheries subsidies have intensified as WTO members seek an outcome at the 11th Ministerial Conference (MC11). To participate meaningfully in the negotiations, SVEs have to identify issues of interest to them and ensure that they are captured in the outcome at MC11. This briefing paper assesses the current proposals on the negotiating table to determine whether or not they take into account the interests of SVEs. It concludes by suggesting strategic options on how SVEs can structure approaches to negotiations on strengthening disciplines on subsidies in the fisheries sector.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
989;Oceans, seas and other marine resources are essential to human well-being and social and economic development worldwide. Their conservation and sustainable use are central to achieving the 2030 Agenda, especially for small island developing States. Marine resources are particularly important for people living in coastal communities, who represented 37 per cent of the world population in 2010. Oceans provide livelihoods, subsistence and benefits from fisheries, tourism and other sectors. They also help regulate the global ecosystem by absorbing heat and carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. However, oceans and coastal areas are extremely vulnerable to environmental degradation, overfishing, climate change and pollution;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
990;The OECD Fisheries Support Estimate (FSE) database collects and classifies information on budgetary transfers to the fisheries sector in 31 countries that together account for 35% of global fisheries landings. In 2015, the most recent year, it inventories policies and programmes totalling USD 7 billion. Most of this support is found to be directed towards general services to the fishing sector, mainly in the form of fisheries management costs, but also for, inter alia, infrastructure, research and stock enhancement. Approximately USD 500 million per year is used for programmes that deliver funds directly in the hands of fishers. The share of this form of support has been decreasing over time. Payments based on the use of variable inputs are found to be the most likely to provoke increased fishing effort, while payments based on fixed capital formation are most likely to encourage increased capacity levels. Payments based on fishers income are less likely to increase effort or capacity and may be more effective at improving the welfare of fishers. Payments to general services for the sector are least likely to increase effort or fishing capacity.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
991;This paper identifies the progress achieved by individual countries in implementing internationally recognised best policies and practices against illegal, unreported and unregulated (IUU) fishing since 2005. It aims to inspire and guide governments and all stakeholders in the fisheries sector in how to focus their effort and investment to step up their fight against IUU fishing. The paper builds on a suite of policy indicators that investigate the extent to which countries meet their responsibilities in the most important dimensions of government intervention in relation to IUU fishing. The indicators show considerable improvement in fighting IUU fishing over the last decade, in line with international treaties and voluntary agreements. They also point to the gaps that need to be closed to individually and collectively work towards eliminating IUU fishing.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;
992;2017 HLPF Thematic review of SDG 14: Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development1 SDG 14 is dedicated to humanity’s interactions with the oceans. It covers a range of issues in the area of conservation and sustainable use, with seven targets and three means of implementation to respond to the urgent need for transformative change toward more sustainable practices. Oceans cover around 71% of the Earth's surface and perform a vital regulatory function in the global weather and climate systems. Even the livelihoods and lifestyles of people living far inland often depend directly on rainfall and temperature patterns moderated by distant oceans. SDG 14 recognises the environmental, economic and social benefits that healthy oceans provide, and that resources and services 2 are being eroded by a range of anthropogenic pressures that are potentially manageable and within the SDG14’s scope to improve.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;;

1026;Protecting important sites for terrestrial and freshwater biodiversity is vital for ensuring long-term and sustainable use of terrestrial and freshwater natural resources. The global mean percentage of each key biodiversity area covered by protected areas increased from 33.1 per cent in 2000 to 46.1 per cent in 2018 for terrestrial areas, from 30.5 per cent in 2000 to 43.2 per cent in 2018 for freshwater areas, and from 32.9 per cent in 2000 to 44.7 per cent in 2018 for mountain areas.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1027;Healthy mountain ecosystems are fundamental to ensuring the provision of ecosystem services to upland communities as well as lowland peoples. As of 2017, 76 per cent of the world’s mountain areas were covered by a form of green coverage: 41 per cent by forests, 29 per cent by grassland/shrubland and only 6 per cent by cropland.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1028;The most fundamental and irreversible human impact on nature is species extinction. The Red List Index – which measures the risk of extinction, in which a value of 1 indicates no threat to any species, and a value of 0 indicates that all species are extinct – has deteriorated from 0.82 in 1993 to 0.73 globally in 2019.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1029;The Earth’s forest areas continue to shrink, down from 4.1 billion hectares in 2000 (or 31.2 per cent of total land area) to about 4 billion hectares (30.7 per cent of total land area) in 2015. However, the rate of forest loss has been cut by 25 per cent since 2000–2005.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1030;Illicit poaching and trafficking of wildlife continues to thwart conservation efforts, with nearly 7,000 species of animals and plants reported in illegal trade involving 120 countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1031;Since 1993, the global Red List Index of threatened species has fallen from 0.82 to 0.74, indicating an alarming trend in the decline of mammals, birds, amphibians, corals and cycads. The primary drivers of this assault on biodiversity are habitat loss from unsustainable agriculture, deforestation, unsustainable harvest and trade, and invasive alien species.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1032;Fifteen per cent of land is currently under protection, but that does not cover all areas important for biodiversity. Protecting key biodiversity areas is necessary to strengthen natural resource management and biodiversity conservation. From 2000 to 2017, average worldwide coverage of terrestrial, freshwater and mountain key biodiversity areas by protected areas increased from 35 per cent to 47 per cent, from 32 per cent to 43 per cent and from 39 per cent to 49 per cent, respectively.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1033;The net loss of forest continues to slow and forest biomass stock per hecta re is stable. More forests are being protected and areas under long-term management plans and voluntary certification have increased. From 2010 to 2015, the annual net loss of forest area globally was less than half that of the 1990s. The proportion of land area covered by forest decreased from 31.6 per cent in 1990 to 30.8 per cent in 2010 and 30.6 per cent in 2015.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1034;As of 2017, 76 per cent of the world’s mountain areas are covered by some form of green vegetation, including forests, shrubs, grasses and crops. Green cover on mountains is lowest in Central Asia (31 per cent) and highest in Oceania (excluding Australia and New Zealand) (98 per cent).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1035;Wildlife poaching and trafficking continues to thwart conservation efforts. Illicit wildlife markets are complex and subject to rapid fluctuations. Demand for a given wildlife product can grow quickly, before the international community can react. In 2013, elephant ivory, rosewood and rhinoceros horn comprised over 60 per cent of total wildlife and timber product seizures.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1036;A forest is a large area of land dominated by trees.  Hundreds of more precise definitions of forest are used throughout the world, incorporating factors such as tree density, tree height, land use, legal standing and ecological function. According to the widely used Food and Agriculture Organization definition, forests covered 4 billion hectares (9.9×109 acres) (15 million square miles) or approximately 30 percent of the world's land area in 2006.Forests are the dominant terrestrial ecosystem of Earth, and are distributed around the globe. Forests account for 75% of the gross primary production of the Earth's biosphere, and contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass. Net primary production is estimated at 21.9 gigatonnes carbon per year for tropical forests, 8.1 for temperate forests, and 2.6 for boreal forests.Forests at different latitudes and elevations form distinctly different ecozones: boreal forests around the poles, tropical forests around the Equator, and temperate forests at the middle latitudes. Higher elevation areas tend to support forests similar to those at higher latitudes, and amount of precipitation also affects forest composition.\nHuman society and forests influence each other in both positive and negative ways. Forests provide ecosystem services to humans and serve as tourist attractions. Forests can also affect people's health. Human activities, including harvesting forest resources, can negatively affect forest ecosystems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1037;Land, sometimes referred to as dry land, is the solid surface of Earth that is not permanently covered by water. The vast majority of human activity throughout history has occurred in land areas that support agriculture, habitat, and various natural resources. Some life forms (including terrestrial plants and terrestrial animals) have developed from predecessor species that lived in bodies of water.\nAreas where land meets large bodies of water are called coastal zones. The division between land and water is a fundamental concept to humans. The demarcation line between land and water can vary by local jurisdiction and other factors. A maritime boundary is one example of a political demarcation. A variety of natural boundaries exist to help clearly define where water meets land. Solid rock landforms are easier to demarcate than marshy or swampy boundaries, where there is no clear point at which the land ends and a body of water has begun. Demarcation lines can further vary due to tides and weather.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1038;Implementation of Goal 15 is showing some encouraging signs. Forest loss has slowed. A growing number of forest areas are being sustainably managed, integrating policies and practices that protect forest ecosystems and address drivers of degradation. All regions continue to make progress on conferring official protection status to areas critical to global biodiversity. However, land degradation is increasing due to competing pressures for food, energy and shelter. Biodiversity loss is occurring at an alarming rate. In addition, invasive species, the illicit poaching and trafficking of wildlife, and falling trends in ODA in support of biodiversity continue to thwart efforts to protect and restore vital ecosystems and species. Accelerated action is urgently needed to preserve and promote the sustainable use of ecosystems on which all life depends.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1039;"Human activity continues to erode the health of ecosystems on which all species depend. The loss of forests is slowing but continues at an alarming rate; one million plant and animal species are at risk of extinction according to a recent United Nations report, and an estimated 20 per cent of the Earth’s land area was degraded between 2000 and 2015. Many countries are taking measures to conserve, restore and make sustainable use of those invaluable natural resources. They are adopting legal mechanisms to ensure the fair sharing of benefits from genetic resources, protecting more KBAs, and implementing sustainable forest management plans. But those efforts must be scaled up—urgently. The severity of the situation requires immediate action and a fundamental transformation of our relationship with the Earth to halt biodiversity loss and protect ecosystems for the benefit of all.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1040;Protected and restored ecosystems and the biodiversity they support can help mitigate climate change and provide increased resilience in the face of increased human pressures and mounting disasters. Healthy ecosystems also produce multiple benefits for all communities: clean air, water, food, raw materials and medicines, to name a few. To date, progress in preserving and sustainably using terrestrial ecosystems and protecting biodiversity has been uneven. The pace of forest loss has slowed, and improvements continue to be made in managing forests sustainably and safeguarding areas important for biodiversity. That said, accelerating biodiversity loss, along with continued poaching and trafficking of wildlife, is alarming. Moreover, from 1998 to 2013, about one fifth of the Earth’s land surface covered by vegetation showed persistently declining trends in productivity. Soil and land degradation undermines the security and development of all countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1041;"Latvia’s forests, grasslands, wetlands, and Baltic marine and coastal areas are biodiversity-rich and provide home to numerous species of international significance. However, the conservation status of most habitats and species continues to decline and biodiversity considerations are not sufficiently integrated into sectoral policies. This chapter reviews pressures influencing the status and trends of biodiversity; the legal, strategic and institutional framework; policy instruments and financing established to promote biodiversity conservation and sustainable use; and the degree to which biodiversity considerations have been mainstreamed into sectoral policies.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1042;This section explains key positive drivers for SFM, forest conservation, afforestation and reforestation. Direct drivers that enable positive changes of forests in the GMS include human activities that directly promote and enhance SFM, forest conservation, afforestation and reforestation. Indirect drivers of positive changes are the underlying policies and enabling environments supporting them. Direct and indirect positive drivers are interlinked and thus it is challenging to separate them completely. They both interact to induce positive changes. For example, good policy environment (an indirect positive driver) may provide incentives for conservation and SFM activities (a direct positive driver), which may result in better forest management outcomes.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1043;Policy instruments ultimately guide the behaviour of actors in land-use systems, so understanding the interactions between policy instruments and how this impacts land use is key for managing outcomes in the land-use, biodiversity, climate and food nexus. The chapter highlights the need for secure and clear land tenure as a prerequisite for effective policymaking. It then analyses some important regulatory, economic, information and voluntary instruments currently in use across the case studies (Brazil, France, Indonesia, Ireland, Mexico and New Zealand), including where and how these instruments have been effective. The chapter also explores how to address food loss and waste, which can play an important role in reducing emissions from agriculture and pressure on land-use systems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1044;The forests and forest sector overview have been prepared by the author, in close cooperation with the national experts, according to a standard format, covering context, trends for the forest resource, goods and services provided by the forest, forest products markets and trade, policies and institutions, major challenges for the forest sector and the direction of forest sector policy. There is also in each overview an Annex on state forest related institutions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1045;Conservationists may be roughly divided into three groups whose approaches to wildlife protection appear at odds with one another. Animal rights activists are drawn to a straightforward prohibitionist approach: simply ban the trade in wild species. An opposed constituency argues that these creatures will not survive if they have no economic purpose, and that a regulated international trade is essential for conservation. A third group puts the empowerment of local communities first, rejecting what they see as a neo-colonial dimension to the wildlife protection discourse. The author argues that, as is the case with illegal drugs, the appropriate policy approach depends on the context. There can be no shortcut for understanding the particular dynamics of each wildlife trafficking flow, and pragmatism must trump ideology if we are to have any hope of preserving vulnerable species.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1046;Morocco has a great diversity of ecosystems because it incorporates a range of climatic and physiographic regions. Five main categories of ecosystems are identified in the country’s 2004 Strategy for the Conservation and Sustainable Use of Biodiversity (Biodiversity Strategy), namely, forest and steppic ecosystems, Saharian ecosystems (e.g. regs and ergs), marine and coastal ecosystems, ecosystems of the continental humid zones, and cave ecosystems. These act as a repository for several species of conservation importance. Morocco is indeed important for biodiversity conservation within the broader area of the Mediterranean Basin, which region is considered to be a biodiversity hotspot.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1047;Since the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development,1 which was held in Rio de Janeiro in 1992, awareness of the importance of biodiversity and protecting the condition of terrestrial ecosystems has greatly improved. Factors for protecting biodiversity and creating more sustainable relationships with terrestrial ecosystems, however, are still not well understood. Moreover, the full extent to which the ongoing permanent loss of biodiversity will affect human welfare in the future cannot be entirely known. What is clear, however, is that diversity of species and biomes, or terrestrial landscapes, has been declining, and this trend has major implications for sustainability.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1048;Amazonia is the largest of the six Brazilian biomes, spanning 420 million hectares – or about 49 per cent of the national territory – of which 320 million hectares are covered by natural forests.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1049;Brazil is the world’s most biodiverse country. This chapter reviews the current status and trends of Brazil’s biodiversity, as well as pressures stemming from a range of sources. It examines Brazil’s biodiversity policy and institutional framework, including its integrated strategy to combat deforestation. The chapter assesses progress in financing biodiversity conservation, mainstreaming biodiversity into sectoral policies and enhancing the knowledge base and economic valuation of Brazil’s biodiversity and ecosystems.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1050;"The Central European, Sub-Mediterranean, Mediterranean and Pontic floristic regions meet in Bulgaria, creating a particularly high biodiversity. As the southern mountains (Strandja, Rhodopes) were spared from the last glaciation, a large number of relict and endemic species can be found in the country; the richness in species is among the highest in all of Europe.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1051;Biological diversity plays an essential role in maintaining life-support systems and quality of life, and provides key resources and services for the economy. Its preservation is key to a sustainable development. The indicators here show threatened species, protected areas, forest resources and land cover.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1052;"The study Green Jobs in the Forest Sector provides an overview of existing Green Forest Jobs and identifies possible areas for future activities and jobs in the forest sector, and may serve as starting point for further analysis and discussion on the future of Green Forest Jobs. It offers a framework for classifying Green Forest Jobs under seven thematic work areas, outlined in the seven main sections of the study, with a particular focus on major trends, needs and challenges as well as opportunities and prospects for the forest sector. The findings suggest that to promote Green Jobs in the forest sector it is key to: (i) look at forest ecosystem services management as the frame for Green Forest Jobs; (ii) recognize the progress made in the development of Green Forest Jobs and to identify avenues for the future; (iii) enhance the public perception of jobs in the forest sector; (iv) revise existing curricula and develop new ones for catering to the needs of the sector to close the skills gaps; and (v) to facilitate an inclusive transition to green economy through training and support.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1053;This study, focusing primarily on the period from the collapse of the Soviet Union until the present day, identifies the key drivers of forest degradation and the potential for forest landscape restoration in the Caucasus and Central Asia. The study was undertaken to support the preparation of restoration pledges in the eight countries of the Caucasus and Central Asia in the run up to the Ministerial Roundtable on Forest Landscape Restoration and the Bonn Challenge in the Caucasus and Central Asia that took place in June 2018 in Astana, Kazakhstan. At this Roundtable Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan committed to restore over 2.5 million ha of forest landscapes by 2030;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1054;This paper presents green economy related definitions and concepts, and internationally developed assessment methods, notably natural capital accounting approaches, and in this way explore aligning forest sector approaches to those being used in wider contexts. It also proposes preliminary suggestions on how the forest sector’s contribution to a green economy could be measured.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1055;This chapter examines the institutional drivers that cause development firms to implement biodiversity offsets. Developers may undertake offsets to comply with a jurisdiction’s legislation, as a condition of project lending approval or as part of a voluntary corporate risk management strategy. The institutional frameworks that facilitate biodiversity offsets affect outcomes in each of the environmental, economic and distributional domains. The chapter concludes by contrasting the characteristic outcomes from implementing biodiversity offsets under different institutional frameworks.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1056;Demand for elephant ivory and rhino horn has driven dramatic growth in illegal wildlife markets in recent years due primarily to a growing consumer base in East Asia. All forms of wildlife trafficking taken together constitute one of the most lucrative forms of illicit trade, according to some estimates, and the sector has more than doubled since 2007. This chapter points to publicly available reports on population declines, trafficking routes and the quantity of wildlife contraband reported. It highlights reports on the geographic hubs and hotspots of wildlife trafficking routes, and argues that monitoring and enforcement in source countries can be effective means to reduce poaching, but capacities are low and need support in the form of training and information systems. It presents the Information Sharing Platform built for the OECD Task Force on Charting Illicit Trade, and encourages stakeholders to join this to reinforce collective action to counter illicit trade in wildlife.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1057;Mainstreaming biodiversity across government and society is crucial for meeting many of the Sustainable Development Goals. This chapter provides an overview of the interlinkages between biodiversity and sustainable development and highlights assessment frameworks and entry points for biodiversity mainstreaming. Drawing on experiences and lessons learned from 16 of some of the most biodiverse countries in the world, the chapter concludes with the key messages and good practice insights from across the report.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1058;National and sub-national institutions play a key role in land use. Ensuring co-ordination both between national institutions (horizontal co-ordination) and national and sub-national institutions (vertical co-ordination) is important for policy alignment in the land-use, biodiversity, climate and food nexus. This chapter highlights the degree of co-ordination between relevant government institutions and the mechanisms for co-ordination in the case study countries (Brazil, France, Indonesia, Ireland, Mexico and New Zealand). The chapter provides examples of horizontal co-ordination and how relevant national level ministries work together to produce policy and manage nexus areas. It then highlights the challenges facing existing mechanisms for vertical co-ordination. The chapter also discusses the role of institutions in international trade including the role of the private sector for managing nexus impacts.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1059;As natural and cultural heritage sites provide values to society, the Nordic countries have various programs and initiatives aiming to protect these areas to ensure that they will continue to generate value. While the goal and the challenges are mostly similar in all Nordic countries the conservation strategies differ between the countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1060;Biodiversity loss is a major environmental challenge facing humankind. Despite some local successes, biodiversity is on the decline globally and this loss is projected to continue. Continuing with business as usual may have far-reaching adverse implications for human well-being, security and economic growth. This chapter summarises the considerable benefits and often hidden values of biodiversity and the ecosystems of which it is a part. It then looks at trends in several indicators of biodiversity – species abundance (e.g. mean species abundance or MSA), threatened species, forest area (deforestation) and marine fish stocks – and the implications of business-as-usual trends continuing to the year 2050 under the OECD Environmental Outlook Baseline scenario. The chapter provides an overview of the different policy instruments available for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, ranging from regulations to market-driven approaches, such as payments for ecosystem services (PES). Some more ambitious policy scenarios are examined – such as the implications of meeting the Aichi Biodiversity Target under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to expand the global protected area network to at least 17% of terrestrial land by 2020. Possible synergies and trade-offs of meeting climate mitigation goals (through different bioenergy and land use scenarios, for example) and the impacts on biodiversity are also examined. The chapter concludes with a discussion of key needs for further policy action in the context of biodiversity and how this links to the broader green growth agenda.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1061;Argentina’s agriculture sector has transformed at an accelerated pace in recent years with new technologies and the expansion of the agricultural frontier. This has opened new opportunities for the sector but has increased environmental pressures. The trends in the agri-environmental indicators reveal that most of these pressures are still lower than in OECD countries. However, deforestation rates in Argentina are high and the use of pesticides per area of cropland has risen at rates well above the OECD average. In the context of reducing export taxes on the main exporting commodities, it is important to strengthen the Native Forest Law and good environmental practices on the use of pesticides and rotation, potentially incorporating targeted instruments to enhance the responsibility of producers in reducing negative agri‑environmental externalities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1062;Croatia includes 3 of the 11 biogeographical regions present in Europe: Alpine, Continental and Mediterranean, but also there are some elements of the Pannonian region. The number of known taxa (species and subspecies) is almost 38,000 (table 8.1). Many species are under threat or at different levels of threat. The most vulnerable are freshwater fish, reptiles, amphibians, dragonflies and birds (table 8.2).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1063;The Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) was adopted at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992. Government leaders from more than 150 countries confirmed at the world summit in Johannesburg 10 years later that the convention is the key instrument for the conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits arising from use of genetic resources.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1064;Poaching is a persistent global problem with a profound effect on the East African region. The international demand for ivory and rhino horn is fuelling catastrophic declines in the elephant and rhino populations in Kenya, Tanzania and throughout Africa. As is the case for many countries in Africa, in Kenya wildlife crime has evolved over time and presents new challenges to wildlife conservation. Kenya’s estimated 33,000 elephants and 1,010 rhinos, in addition to a mosaic of other wildlife, are concentrated not only in national parks, but scattered throughout the country across officially protected areas, private ranches, county council territories, and both communal and private lands.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1065;"Page 1 of 10 2018 HLPF Background Note - Review of progress towards achieving SDG 15: “Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial ecosystems, sustainably manage forests, combat deforestation and halt and reverse land degradation and biodiversity loss”1 Introduction Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15) addresses the conservation and sustainable use of forests, other terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity, including halting desertification and land degradation and combatting illegal trade in endangered species. SDG 15 is a very ambitious goal—it encompasses all types of land-based ecosystems and biodiversity, with 12 targets and 12 indicators 2 that draw heavily from the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the current Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. Both urban and rural societies rely on terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity in various ways to strengthen their resilience. Vegetation acts as a carbon sink for partially offsetting urban emissions, and contributes to climate change mitigation through shade provision, rainwater interception and filtration, and pollution reduction. Increasing the biodiversity 1 This background note was prepared by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs’ Office of Intergovernmental Support and Coordination for Sustainable Development (UN-DESA/OISC) in collaboration with experts from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), and the UN Development Programme (UNDP); the Secretariats of the UN Forum on Forests, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, The Ramsar Convention, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species; the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS); and with inputs from the participants of the UN-DESA Expert Group Meeting on SDG 15 convened from 14 to 15 May 2018, as a contribution to the 2018 HLPF review of SDG 15.

1066;Page 2 of 10 of food systems can enhance resilience through food and nutrition security, and local food systems have historically proved to be critical to a community’s survival in the face of food security crises. The achievement of SDG 15 is therefore central to providing the environmental services essential for ensuring safe and adequate water supplies, supporting sustainable food systems, and mitigating climate change. Actions for implementation also directly affect the lives and wellbeing of many indigenous peoples and local communities often viewed as excluded, marginalized or at risk of being left behind. Status and Trends3 Progress toward SDG 15 is mixed. At the global level, there is progress along indicators related to actions (e.g. numbers of protected areas), but indicators related to status (e.g. IUCN Red List numbers and state of species) are still negative. The average proportion of important sites for biodiversity covered by protected areas continues to increase—as of January 2018, the average proportion of each Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) for freshwater, terrestrial and mountain biodiversity covered by protected areas was 44 per cent, 47 per cent and 48 per cent, respectively. Yet biodiversity continues to be lost at an accelerated rate, largely due to human activities. Changes in species extinction risk are measured by the Red List Index, which incorporates data on more than 20,000 animal and plant species, indicating an increasing risk of extinction for species as the index moves toward zero. Since 1993, the Red List Index has declined from 0.82 to 0.74 globally. The primary drivers of this biodiversity loss are habitat loss from unsustainable agriculture, deforestation, unsustainable harvest and trade, and alien invasive species. A review of progress toward achieving the Aichi Biodiversity Targets in the 2014 Global Biodiversity Outlook projected that out of 53 target elements, only five were on track to be reached by 2020. The recent regional assessment reports issued by the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) found that biodiversity is in decline in all regions of the world.4 It is hoped that an effective post-2020 global framework for biodiversity—a more ambitious, unambiguous, unified 3 Data on status and trends in this section is referenced from the Report of the Secretary-General on Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals (E/2018/64).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;

Page 3 of 10 and politically relevant response to halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030—can be adopted by the 15th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2020, and incorporated within the 2030 Agenda. Forests covered about four billion hectares—31 per cent—of the world’s land area in 2015. While global rates of deforestation have decreased in the recent past from a net annual forest area loss of 7.3 million hectares in 2000 to 3.3 million hectares in 2015, they are still alarmingly high. The main driver of deforestation continues to be conversion of forests to agricultural land. In addition, forest degradation is increasing globally, mainly due to unsustainable use, often driven by poverty or poor land governance. Mountains cover about 22 percent of the Earth’s surface and are vital sources of water, energy, biodiversity, agricultural products and livelihoods for a large portion of the world’s population. In 2017, 76 per cent of mountain areas were covered by some form of green vegetation, including forests, shrubs, grassland and cropland, which tends to be positively correlated to the health of the mountains and their capacity to provide ecosystem services; but mountain ecosystems and the people who inhabit them are also highly vulnerable to disturbances. About one fifth of the Earth’s land surface covered by vegetation showed persistent and declining trends in productivity from 1998 to 2013. Up to 24 million km2 of land was affected, including 19 per cent of cropland, 16 per cent of forestland, 19 per cent of grassland and 28 per cent of rangeland. In some cases, advanced stages of land degradation are leading to desertification in dryland areas, particularly in the grasslands and rangelands. It is estimated that 60 per cent of terrestrial biodiversity loss is related to food production, while ecosystem services to support food production are under pressure, with 33 per cent of soils moderately to highly degraded and freshwater ecosystems adversely impacted by water extraction for agriculture and other uses, and by pollution.5 Globally, around 3.2 billion people are adversely affected by land degradation, and an estimated two billion hectares—equivalent to 17 per cent of all biologically productive land—could benefit from restoration.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1068;More than 70 per cent of forest land is owned by governments, while up to 75 per cent of agricultural land are family farms, a large majority of which are smaller than two hectares in size. Indigenous peoples inhabit and manage nearly 22 per cent of the Earth’s 5 UNEP (2016) Food Systems and Natural Resources. A Report of the Working Group on Food Systems of the International Resources Panel. Page 4 of 10 surface, an area that collectively contains around 80 per cent of the planet’s biodiversity. Local and indigenous communities, farmers, pastoralists, foresters, fisherfolk and small- scale producers are custodians of terrestrial ecosystems, and largely depend on these ecosystems for their livelihoods. They play a crucial and increasingly acknowledged role in stopping and reversing negative trends through their use of agro-ecological knowledge. Considerable progress has been made in recognizing and securing community-based tenure rights and access to benefit sharing mechanisms in the context of biodiversity protection, combatting climate change, or land restoration initiatives. However, in many cases tenure rights are unclear, effectively incentivizing exploitation rather than sustainable management and longer-term investments. As part of the commitment by Member States to promote fair and equitable sharing of the benefits arising from the utilization of genetic resources, as of February 2018, 105 countries had ratified the Nagoya Protocol (up from 96 countries in 2017) and 50 countries had shared information on their access and benefit-sharing (ABS) frameworks. For the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture, there are now 144 Contracting Parties, and 22 countries have thus far provided information about their ABS measures. Illegal wildlife trade and the poaching that it fuels have devastating effects on multiple species of animals and plants globally. Illicit poaching and trafficking of wildlife continues to thwart conservation efforts, with nearly 7,000 species of animals and plants reported in illegal trade involving 120 countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1069;This threatens the species’ survival, undermines local livelihoods and food security, and has negative impacts on ecosystem function and services from water supplies to climate change mitigation. Corruption and weak governance typically facilitates illegal trafficking. The global scale of the trade enables the emergence and spread of zoonotic diseases, provides revenue for organized crime syndicates, and is increasingly recognized as a local and national security threat. The current global political climate for addressing these issues is favorable, but efforts to translate this momentum into solid action in many countries are still hampered by weak national capacity and governance, and low political will. Together, these limit the level of national action and transnational cooperation, which are needed to deliver successfully on the urgent action called for in SDG15 to end poaching and trafficking. In response to ongoing biological invasions, national governments are increasingly committed to preventing introductions of invasive alien species and managing existing invasions. Since 2010, the percentage of countries that have enacted national legislation Page 5 of 10 relevant to the prevention and management of invasive alien species has increased by 19 per cent. To date, 55 per cent of countries have enacted overarching national legislation to prevent, control and limit the spread and impact of invasive alien species. The global trend in legislative response has been positive for the few last decades and accelerated in the 1990s but then slowed somewhat in the 2000s. In 2016, bilateral official development assistance (ODA) in support of biodiversity was $7 billion, a decrease of 21 per cent in real terms over 2015. T;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1070;"The only data available on resource mobilization for biodiversity conservation and ecosystem protection is from the OECD DAC’s donor database, which contains “Rio markers” tracking ODA directed to the Rio conventions, including the CBD. By that measure, the trend in biodiversity-related ODA has been on average positive since 2000, but with considerable variability and a steep drop following the 2008 financial crisis. As of 2014, ODA for biodiversity from DAC donors stood at a little under $3.5 billion. No data are available on domestic public investment in such measures, nor on private domestic or international investment. Over the last century, humanity has experienced significant gains in social and economic development, but these are unsustainable, and have come at the expense of the Earth’s natural capital. Interlinked and cross-cutting drivers of loss include market failures, in which the price of goods and services do not reflect the full social and environmental costs of production over time; policy failures, in which government and private policies, plans and investments do not adequately safeguard ecosystem services and biodiversity, short- term economic gain is prioritized over long-term benefits, trade-offs between ecosystem services benefits is inequitable among stakeholders, and there is an unbalanced distribution of land rights; and governance failures, in which rules and laws are unevenly or inadequately applied, and weak or no environmental and social safeguards exist. The resulting imbalances that pose a growing threat to all life underscore why SDG 15 is such an important and challenging goal to achieve. Successes and challenges Integrated approaches to improve conservation of species and ecosystems, restore degraded lands, sustainably increase food production, reduce food loss and waste, and develop more climate-friendly agriculture are emerging in many places, and are being scaled up. Encouragingly, momentum for forest and landscape restoration is building. Though forest loss continues, trees are increasing in number and variety across many";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1071;Page 6 of 10 landscapes, bringing diversity and value to an increasing number of the world’s farms, in and around cities, and across highly varied landscapes that have seen forests and trees disappear in previous decades. The recent adoption of the UN Strategic Plan for Forests 2030 (UNSPF) and its Global Forest Goals (GFGs) by the UNGA provides an opportunity for all partners and stakeholders to join forces to accelerate forest-related progress, as it serves as a global framework for action at all levels to sustainably manage all types of forests and trees outside forests, and to halt deforestation and forest degradation. The three Rio Conventions each recognize the importance of terrestrial ecosystems and sustainable agriculture and forestry for achieving their respective goals. In support of key Convention decisions, numerous mechanisms and partnerships have emerged, including the Landscapes for People, Food and Nature partnership, the UN-REDD Programme6 and the Global Partnership on Forest and Landscape Restoration.7 The latter is supporting governments, the private sector, local communities and others in their efforts to achieve the “Bonn Challenge”: as of May 2018, 47 countries have pledged to have more than 160 million hectares of degraded forests and landscapes under active restoration by 2020,8 with a view to scale up to 350 million hectares by 2030.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1072;"It is estimated that this could generate $9 trillion of net benefits, including from new jobs, increased food production and improved ecosystem services; and sequester 1 Gigaton of greenhouse gases every year. Watershed-based and landscape-based approaches have been proven to work in various contexts, and efforts to achieve land degradation neutrality (LDN), establish legal and inclusive value chains, promote REDD+, and conduct strategic environmental assessments are increasing. At the same time, other levers of change are being engaged—including combatting corruption, promoting transparency and developing effective law enforcement both within and across borders, especially in relation to poaching and trafficking. Global awareness of the scale and broad implications of the wildlife trafficking crisis has risen greatly in recent years, including at the highest levels of many governments. This has translated into significant additional funding streams from many donors to tackle the issue, as well as policy changes such as bans on domestic ivory trade in certain key 6  and www.un-redd.org 7 For more information visit  8 The pledges have now surpassed the original target, set in 2011, of 150 million hectares under active restoration by 2020    Page 7 of 10 countries. On the ground, the spreading use of enforcement tools and technologies have led to greatly increased protection in areas where they have been deployed, although this has not yet occurred at sufficient scale to be effective in protecting trafficked species across large parts of their ranges. The complex and flexible nature of the criminal networks continue to be a major challenge to law enforcement, especially in the context of corruption at multiple points in the trade chain.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1073;Knowledge of how to change behavior to reduce purchases of trafficked wildlife remains a challenge. Successes need to be replicated broadly and rapidly to ensure that trafficked species can be conserved and, where necessary, recover across their ranges, providing all of their multiple benefits to local communities and economies. Investing in nature-based solutions can produce multiple social, environmental, and economic benefits and accelerate progress on the Aichi targets and the SDGs. A range of finance solutions and linked capacity development approaches are already available, from traditional mechanisms such as taxes, subsidies, payment for ecosystem services, and conservation trust funds, to more innovative instruments such as green bonds and green lending, biodiversity offsets, impact investment, and crowd funding. By combining domestic and international finance in ways that make more efficient and effective use of existing public resources, countries are catalyzing the private investment needed to maintain, protect and restore biodiversity and ecosystem services. Recommendations for action: mechanisms and partnerships to accelerate progress Up-scaling the sustainable management of our land and water resources is a precondition for the achievement of all other SDGs. A new narrative is necessary to demonstrate that the tools and solutions for achieving SDG 15 are also essential for goals related to climate change, water, food security, gender equality, and leaving no one behind, and to secure the wholehearted engagement of all relevant actors. Concurrently, it is important to articulate the risks and costs of inaction, and accommodate the need to mitigate impacts from business-as-usual developments in sectors such as agriculture, infrastructure, mining, urbanization, and energy. This can help secure a more holistic approach to implementation, integrating SDG 15 across a range of goals and targets through various approaches such as valuation and risk assessments, using a range of different methodologies. Such methods must also stimulate the removal;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1074;"Page 8 of 10 and reform of harmful subsidies and other economic instruments, and provide guidance towards more effective regulation, taxation and pricing. Given the centrality of biodiversity conservation and sustainable use of forests to SDG 15, the Convention on Biological Diversity and the UN Forum on Forests will play a critical role in its achievement. Likewise, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification will be instrumental in addressing land degradation, while CITES will be vital to combatting illegal wildlife trade. Fostering adequate communication, coordination and cooperation across the different agreements, instruments, and fora is important in capturing synergies and minimizing trade-offs among SDG 15 targets and other SDGs. SDG 13 on climate change is particularly pertinent to the future survival of biodiversity and the health of the ecosystems on which it vitally depends. Capacity building to support implementation is critical. Recognizing that most Government structures are not well-suited to integrated spatial planning approaches, it is recommended that countries should establish institutions at the national level that have authority to work across sectors and integrate SDG 15 targets across other national priorities in a spatially explicit manner. For example, national statistical agencies have more experience with socio-economic measurements than environmental agencies;";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1075;Ministries of Environment and Biodiversity are often unable to participate effectively in cross-sectoral dialogue. Coordinated actions and new ways of collaboration can create enabling environments for producers to accelerate change to more sustainable practices, and act as effective stewards of terrestrial ecosystems. Appropriate private sector investments and campaigns to transform consumer behavior can be very effective. Multi-stakeholder collaboration and partnerships (e.g. the Mountain Partnership) can be emulated, replicated and scaled up. Key areas to strengthen implementation mechanisms and partnerships include: • Securing tenure over forests, pastures and farmlands for local communities and Indigenous Peoples. • Strengthening producers’ organizations and Indigenous Peoples’ groups to ensure their access to information, rights, quality input, new technologies and practices, funding and markets. • Supporting and scaling up the adoption of sustainable production systems to manage land, trees and forests, crop, livestock and fisheries in a more sustainable Page 9 of 10 and integrated way, taking agro-ecological knowledge into account. • Fostering investments in rural areas that involve small-scale producers and supporting their transition to more sustainable practices.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1076;"These and other initiatives—such as the GEF Small Grants Programme, the National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plans (NBSAP) Forum, and the Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services Network (BES-Net)—support a range of partnership mechanisms at the global, regional, national, and community level. The monitoring framework of SDG 15 does not yet capture essential elements related to quality that are crucial for more meaningful results, pointing to the need for additional indicators in areas such as forest intactness, management effectiveness of protected areas, and meaningful integration of biodiversity into other processes. No indicator exists yet to measure the integration of ecosystem and biodiversity values into national planning; it is likely that a future indicator will be based on national self-assessments of progress towards national targets, possibly with a rating system to provide a degree of standardization. Beyond understanding how reaching targets across all the SDGs will accelerate progress toward SDG 15 in more integrated ways, the challenge now is to apply this understanding to the policies and actions that will have transformative effects, to create sustainable and resilient societies. Guiding Questions Page 10 of 10 1. How can we change the narrative of how we approach SDG 15 to capture a more holistic accounting of the value of nature and its ecosystems, and what role can Governments play? 2. What are the evidence-based conservation solutions – including recent scientific and technological advances as well as effective community management and partnerships – that deliver genuine impact and can be scaled up or replicated for success? 3. Which are the most critical interlinkages with other goals and targets in terms of co-benefits or trade-offs? How can they be leveraged towards progress? 4. Who are the furthest behind, and who is at risk of being left behind for this SDG? 5. How can we improve the indicator set used to track progress towards SDG 15, given that several are Tier III and others Tier II?";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;
1077; • Improving collaboration and coordination across governments and with different partners to provide a consistent enabling environment for producers to also act as custodian of the ecosystems they use for production. • Engaging local communities, drawing upon traditional knowledge and promoting the inclusion of women and indigenous populations. Various global finance and capacity building initiatives have been designed to support the CBD, UNFCCC and CITES, with support from the Global Environment Fund (GEF) and other multilateral and bilateral sources such as the Biodiversity Finance Initiative (BIOFIN), the Partnership for Action on Green Economy (PAGE), the Poverty-Environment Action for Sustainable Development (PEAS), and the Green Commodities Programme, as well as thematic programmes on financing linked to forests, mountains, agriculture and land management, and illegal wildlife trade.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;;

1111;The number of intentional homicides per 100,000 people increased from 6.0 in 2015 to 6.1 in 2017. This slight uptick was largely the result of an increase in the homicide rates in Latin America and the Caribbean and in some countries in sub-Saharan Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1112;Various forms of violence against children persist. In 83 countries (mostly from developing regions) with recent data on the subject, nearly 8 in 10 children from 1 to 14 years of age were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home. In all but seven of these countries, at least half of children experienced violent disciplinary methods. Sexual violence is perhaps the most disturbing of children’s rights violations. Based on the limited data available, in 14 of 46 countries with comparable data, at least 5 per cent of women between the ages of 18 and 29 experienced sexual intercourse or other sexual acts that were forced, physically or in other ways, for the first time before they were 18 years of age.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1113;There has been an overall increase in the detection of victims of trafficking in persons, which could reflect either a positive (enhanced efforts by authorities to identify victims) or negative (larger trafficking problem) development. In a departure from prior findings, recent data show that most trafficking victims were detected domestically: 58 per cent in 2016, up from 43 per cent in 2014. The vast majority (70 per cent) of detected victims of human trafficking were women and girls, most of whom were trafficked for sexual exploitation.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1114;The share of unsentenced detainees in the overall prison population has remained largely constant at 30 per cent in recent years. This occurred in a context where the total prison population grew in absolute values while remaining constant as a share of the total population.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1115;Binding laws and policies giving individuals a right to access information held by public authorities have been adopted by 125 countries, with at least 31 countries adopting such laws since 2013. Among the 123 countries for which data on the legal framework is available, 40 do not include the right to appeal to an independent administrative body, which has been assessed as key for the proper implementation of this right.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1116;The pace of progress to put in place national human rights institutions compliant with the Paris Principles must be accelerated. In 2018, a total of 39 per cent of all countries had in place an institution that was fully compliant with the internationally agreed standard, seven countries more than was the case in 2015. If growth continues at the same rate, by 2030 only a little over one half (54 per cent) of all countries worldwide will have compliant national human rights institutions.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1117;The difference between the approved and the implemented budget reflects a government’s ability to achieve development objectives, including delivering services to the public. Deviation between the approved and actual spending during the period 2006–2017 in 108 countries shows that actual spending was within plus or minus 5 per cent of the approved budget in about half of the countries. One out of 10 countries had a deviation of more than plus or minus 15 per cent. Almost half of low-income economies showed more than plus or minus 10 per cent deviation in budget execution.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1118;Nearly 8 in 10 children aged 1 to 14 years were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment on a regular basis at home in 81 countries (primarily developing), according to available data from 2005 to 2017. In all but seven of these countries, more than half of children experienced violent forms of discipline;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1119;"More than 570 different flows involving trafficking in persons were detected between 2012 and 2014, affecting all regions; many involved movement from lower-income to higher-income countries.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1120;The proportion of prisoners held in detention without being sentenced for a crime remained almost constant in the last decade: from 32 per cent in 2003–2005 to 31 per cent in 2014–2016.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1121;Various forms of violence against children are pervasive, including discipline that relies on physical punishment and psychological aggression. In all but 7 of 73 countries and areas with available survey data from 2005 to 2015, more than half of children between the ages of 1 and 14 were subjected to some form of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment at home. In Northern Africa, the share was more than 90 per cent.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1122;The number of victims of intentional homicide worldwide remained relatively stable from 2008 to 2014. The worldwide number of victims of intentional homicide was estimated to be between 4.6 and 6.8 per 100,000 people in 2014, a slight decrease with respect to previous years. Yet during that period, the homicide rate in developing countries was twice that in developed countries, and increased in the least developed countries. Moreover, despite the lack of harmonized data, fatalities and injuries related to armed conflict appear to be increasing in some countries, causing unprecedented population displacements and enormous humanitarian needs.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1123;Peace, justice and effective, accountable and inclusive institutions are at the core of sustainable development. Several regions have enjoyed increased and sustained levels of peace and security in recent decades. But many countries still face protracted armed conflict and violence, and far too many people struggle as a result of weak institutions and the lack of access to justice, information and other fundamental freedoms.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1124;Progress with respect to the rule of law and access to justice is mixed. Globally, the proportion of people held in detention without sentencing decreased slightly, from 32 per cent of total detainees in 2003-2005 to 30 per cent in 2012-2014. However, the percentage for developing regions has consistently been more than two times that of developed regions. In Southern Asia, for instance, more than 2 out of 3 prisoners remained unsentenced in 2012-2014, despite some improvement over the data available for the period 2003 to 2005.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1125;"A peace treaty is an agreement between two or more hostile parties, usually countries or governments, which formally ends a state of war between the parties. It is different from an armistice, which is an agreement to stop hostilities; a surrender, in which an army agrees to give up arms; or a ceasefire or truce, in which the parties may agree to temporarily or permanently stop fighting. The art of negotiating a peace treaty in the modern era has been referred to by legal scholar Christine Bell as the lex pacificatoria, with a peace treaty potentially contributing to the legal framework governing the post conflict period, or jus post bellum.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1126;"Peace is a concept of societal friendship and harmony in the absence of hostility and violence. In a social sense, peace is commonly used to mean a lack of conflict (such as war) and freedom from fear of violence between individuals or groups. Throughout history leaders have used peacemaking and diplomacy to establish a certain type of behavioral restraint that has resulted in the establishment of regional peace or economic growth through various forms of agreements or peace treaties.  Such behavioral restraint has often resulted in the reduction of conflicts, greater economic interactivity, and consequently substantial prosperity.\n""Psychological peace"" (such as a peaceful thinking and emotions) is perhaps less well defined yet often a necessary precursor to establishing ""behavioral peace.""  Peaceful behavior sometimes results from a ""peaceful inner disposition.""  Some have expressed the belief that peace can be initiated with a certain quality of inner tranquility that does not depend upon the uncertainties of daily life for its existence. The acquisition of such a ""peaceful internal disposition"" for oneself and others can contribute to resolving of otherwise seemingly irreconcilable competing interests.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1127;Public security is the function of governments which ensures the protection of citizens, persons in their territory, organizations, and institutions against threats to their well-being – and to the prosperity of their communities.To meet the increasing challenges in the public security area, responsible public institutions and organisations can tap into their own intelligence to successfully address possible threats in advance. They optimise their internal structures, use synergies, and carefully balance costs and benefits of their measures.\nPublic safety organizations  include law enforcement, fire and emergency medical services. The public safety issues that a municipality, county, state, or federal jurisdiction might grapple with include narcotic use, trespassing, burglary, harassment, juvenile delinquency, unauthorized living, noise, littering, inappropriate social behavior, inebriation, and other quality of life issues. Generally organizations are involved in the prevention of and protection from events that could endanger the safety of the general public from significant danger, injury, or property damage, such as crimes or  disasters (natural or human-made);;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1128;"Pacification theory is a counter-hegemonic approach to the study of police and security which views the contemporary security-industrial complex as both an organizing and systematic war strategy targeting domestic and foreign enemies while simultaneously acting as a process that actively fabricates a social order conducive to capitalist accumulation. According to its academic proponents, such an approach to police and security reveals inherent class war dimensions that have been reinforced by police intellectuals since at least the eighteenth century.At base, pacification reflects the need to fabricate productive territories and subjects conducive to exploitation. As Neocleous, Rigakos and Wall explain: ""The extraction of surplus, as Adam Smith admits, can ‘be squeezed out of [the labourer] by violence only, and not by any interest of his own’ if he can subsist otherwise such as through access to communal land. This, in short, is the foundational bourgeois logic for the compulsion to pacify.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1129;A judge is a person who presides over court proceedings, either alone or as a part of a panel of judges. The powers, functions, method of appointment, discipline, and training of judges vary widely across different jurisdictions. The judge is supposed to conduct the trial impartially and, typically, in an open court. The judge hears all the witnesses and any other evidence presented by the barristers or solicitors of the case, assesses the credibility and arguments of the parties, and then issues a ruling on the matter at hand based on their interpretation of the law and their own personal judgment. In some jurisdictions, the judge's powers may be shared with a jury. In inquisitorial systems of criminal investigation, a judge might also be an examining magistrate.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1130;"Justice, in its broadest sense is the principle that people receive that which they deserve; with the interpretation of what then constitutes ""deserving"" being impacted upon by numerous fields, with many differing viewpoints and perspectives, including the concepts of moral correctness based on ethics, rationality, law, religion, equity and fairness. \nConsequently, the appliction of justice differs in every culture. Early theories of justice were set out by the Ancient Greek philosophers Plato in his work The Republic, and Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics. Throughout history various theories have been established. Advocates of divine command theory argue that justice issues from God. In the 1600s, theorists like John Locke argued for the theory of natural law. Thinkers in the social contract tradition argued that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned. In the 1800s, utilitarian thinkers including John Stuart Mill argued that justice is based on the best outcomes for the greatest number of people. Theories of distributive justice concern what is to be distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the proper distribution. Egalitarians argued that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality. John Rawls used a social contract argument to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness. Property rights theorists (like Robert Nozick) also take a consequentialist view of distributive justice and argue that property rights-based justice maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system. Theories of retributive justice are concerned with punishment for wrongdoing. Restorative justice (also sometimes called ""reparative justice"") is an approach to justice that focuses on the needs of victims and offenders.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1131;"A jurist or jurisconsult (from Medieval Latin) is an expert of law or someone who researches jurisprudence. Such a person can be an academic (legal scholar), legal writer, law lecturer and law practitioner (lawyer), depending on legislation in the respective jurisdiction. Professionally, in the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and in many other Commonwealth nations, the word jurist sometimes refers to a barrister and solicitor, whereas in the United States of America it often refers to a judge.Thus a jurist, someone who studies, analyses and comments on law, stands in contrast with a lawyer, someone who applies law on behalf of clients and thinks about it in practical terms.There is a fundamental difference between the work of a lawyer and that of a jurist. Many legal scholars and authors have explained that a person may be both a lawyer and a jurist, but a jurist is not necessarily a lawyer, nor a lawyer necessarily a jurist. Both must possess an acquaintance with the term ""law"". The work of the jurist is the study, analysis and arrangement of the law—work which can be done wholly in the seclusion of the library. The work of the lawyer is the satisfaction of the wishes of particular human beings for legal assistance—work which requires dealing to some extent therefore with people in the office, in the court room, or in the market-place.\nThe term jurist has another sense, which is wider, synonymous with legal professional, i.e. anyone professionally involved with law and justice. In some other European languages, a word resembling jurist (such as Italian giurista, German Jurist, Norwegian/Danish/Swedish/Dutch jurist, French juriste,  Spanish/Catalan/Portuguese jurista, Galician xurista, Russian юрист etc.) is used in this major sense.')";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1132;The United States Department of Justice (DOJ), also known as the Justice Department, is a federal executive department of the United States government responsible for the enforcement of the law and administration of justice in the United States, and is equivalent to the justice or interior ministries of other countries. The department was formed in 1870 during the Ulysses S. Grant administration, and administers several federal law enforcement agencies, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), the United States Marshals Service (USMS), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), and the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). The department is responsible for investigating instances of financial fraud, representing the United States government in legal matters (such as in cases before the Supreme Court), and running the federal prison system. The department is also responsible for reviewing the conduct of local law enforcement as directed by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994.The department is headed by the United States Attorney General, who is nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate and is a member of the Cabinet. As of February 2019, the Attorney General is William Barr.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1133;Progress in promoting peace and justice, and in building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions remains uneven across and within regions. Homicides are slowly declining, and more citizens around the world have better access to justice. However, violent conflicts have increased in recent years, and a number of high-intensity armed conflicts are causing large numbers of civilian casualties and driving millions of people from their homes. Disparities abound: data show that countries with higher income inequality suffer from higher levels of violence. Poorer countries and regions tend to be sources of victims for human traffickers and are more prone to corruption. In response, legal frameworks and institutions are being put in place— for example, on access to information and human rights promotion—but implementation does not always follow suit.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1134;Stability, peace and inclusive societies are important for sustainable development. Some countries in Asia and the Pacific enjoy sustained levels of peace, security and prosperity, others experience long-term cycles of conflict and violence. Sustainable Development Goal 16 is focused not only on peace and inclusive societies but also on justice, crime and governance aspects, as well as legal identity for all. These aspects will be considered in this chapter;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1135;"The integrated and universal approach that is fundamental to the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development is well represented in SDG 16. This goal represents a specific and important extension to the preceding MDGs and is based on the recognition that: 'Sustainable development cannot be realized without peace and security; and peace and security will be at risk without sustainable development'. Equally, sustainable development, peace and security are dependent on universal access to justice and the effective implementation of good governance principles by institutions that are transparent and accountable.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1136;Countries face numerous challenges in their efforts to intercept the finances of terrorist groups and prevent them from buying weapons from transnational organized crime networks. One tried and tested method is through the use of Financial Intelligence Units (FIUs) to analyze and report on suspicious monetary transactions. To support Member States and FIUs against crime and terrorism, UNODC created goAML–Anti-Money Laundering software, which is now used by around 40 countries. The “go” family of products deliver effective software solutions to support the work of law enforcement, intelligence, anti-corruption, and drugs control agencies against the criminals. These products are evidence of how ICTs are actively working for countries on the frontlines in the struggle against transnational organized crime. But ICTs are also helping to achieve the SDGs – here’s how.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1137;Goal 16 sets ambitious targets to reduce all forms of violence, to ensure access to justice for all, to build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions and to ensure responsive, inclusive, accountable and representative decision-making leaving no one behind, among others. Yet, for persons with disabilities, various barriers continue to hinder access to justice, to information, to public services and to decision-making: discrimination and stigma, lack of access and of accessibility, limited representation of persons with disabilities in decision-making, insufficient legal protection and remaining discriminatory laws and policies, particularly electoral laws and laws regulating access to justice and to information.

1138;Chapter 9 discusses the impact of international law and standards on law reform processes, including international human rights law, as well as non-binding model laws. It also explores the important contribution that law reform can make to the realisation of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1139;Illicit financial flows (IFFs) strip countries of important resources. They stem from corruption, crime, terrorism, and tax evasion, and use channels ranging in sophistication from cash smuggling and remittance transfers to trade finance and shell companies. The cross-cutting nature of IFFs requires policymakers and other stakeholders to have a more strategic overview of IFFs. They must assess the potential trade-offs and synergies in an inter-disciplinary manner, better inform policy making upstream, and help government actors to take more effective action. The new OECD Framework for Policy Coherence for Sustainable Development (the “PCSD Framework”) aims to address this challenge by providing a simplified framework and self-screening tool for countries to help them plan for, avoid, and resolve the most significant trade-offs or policy inconsistencies and apply existing international standards in a coherent and effective way.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1140;In 2014, the United Nations continued efforts to promote human rights worldwide. The Optional Protocol to the Convention on the Rights of the Child, which allowed individual children to submit complaints regarding specific violations of their rights under the Convention and its first two protocols, entered into force on 14 April, and in November, the General Assembly convened a high-level meeting on the twenty-fifth anniversary of the Convention. In other activities, an initiative of the Secretary-General, Human Rights Up Front, aimed at strengthening prevention of serious violations, was beginning to identify potential problems earlier.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1141;Illicit financial flows (IFFs) are generated by methods, practices and crimes aiming to transfer financial capital out of a country in contravention of national or international laws. The funds strip urgently needed resources from developing countries, which then lack means to finance their development efforts. Illicit financial flows generally fall in one of four categories: money laundering, bribery and tax evasion by international companies, and trade mispricing. There are many international initiatives underway that aim at combatting illicit financial flows. OECD countries have a large role in this agenda, as OECD country systems in this area often exhibit weaknesses.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1142;"This report has identified several often overlapping or mutually reinforcing criminal economies operating in West Africa. They use different methods, and are enabled by networks of both domestic and international actors. This chapter proposes an analytical framework for understanding the implications of criminal economies and their IFFs, based on three factors: where the good is sourced and whether there is a local market; the actors or networks involved; and where the IFFs are earned and invested. Applying this analytical framework conveys the nature and scope of the criminal economy in question, the underlying actors, interests and incentives behind it and the priority for harm-mitigating responses. It then provides a brief look at 13 different forms of criminal economies, according to a three-part typology: illegal activities, illicit trade in legal goods and illicit resource extraction. Each case provides an overview of the scale of the flow, the geographic area of vulnerability, the key actors involved, and the implications and impacts of illicit financial flows.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1143;Throughout the world, millions of children face violence and fear, much of it hidden from the world’s gaze. We all have a tremendous responsibility to save lives and to end the degrading violence against children that occurs in every country and every region of the world. This not only calls for an integrated response and greater cooperation, but also a recognition of the powerful role that justice systems can play in protecting children and respecting their rights. The UN Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) is committed, along with its partners, to highlighting the connections between justice and the sustainable development goals and contributing to the end of violence against children by 2030. I hope that this article successfully conveys the importance of a fair, effective and humane justice system as a necessary requirement to protect children from violence. In doing so, it makes use of three cases as illustrations and then goes on to outline key issues that should be taken into account if we are to effectively prevent and respond to this pervasive phenomenon.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1144;Conflict, violence and other human rights violations are among the root causes that push migrant and refugee children to leave their countries of origin. Unfortunately, violence does not stop on leaving these countries. Many children continue to experience violence at different stages of their trip to a safe destination. It occurs at the hands of smugglers, in transit countries, during sea crossings and at land borders. In 2015 alone, roughly one third of those who crossed the Mediterranean were children and many of them lost their lives at sea.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1145;Justice is an area of public policy that exemplifies the need for a strong trust relationship between public institutions and citizens. This chapter looks at how trustworthiness is grounded in an understanding of users’ legal needs and how to respond to them through a continuum of legal assistance and justice services. Integrating legal and justice services with other social services (e.g. health, employment), establishing simple gateways (“one-stop shops”) and providing targeted and timely legal assistance services to those facing the most severe problems will maximise social return on investment. Expanding ICT-enabled justice services and processes further helps meet specific needs (e.g. remote communities) and address new policy challenges (e.g. self-representation). Finally, developing transparency and outreach measures (e.g. legal empowerment) will support the development of legal capabilities and improve openness.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1146;Africa is increasingly becoming an important global player, and the international influence affects its geopolitical and socioeconomic landscape. This simple fact also applies to the domain of corruption. Africa’s rich history, diverse cultures and its role in the world arena imply that the international dimension of corruption cannot be neglected. Three main conclusions emerge from this chapter. First, although there is an ambiguous impact of foreign aid on corruption, it cannot be ignored given the critical role of foreign assistance to African countries. Second, cross-border illicit financial flows in Africa are both a critical determinant and a consequence of corruption. Third, the extent of observed cross-border corruption indicates the essential role of foreign actors in promoting corruption in Africa. Lastly, this chapter highlights the importance of domestic and foreign governance institutions in examining the international dimension of corruption in Africa.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1147;Responses to young people associated with violent acts often emphasize punitive, repressive and militarized approaches. Aggressive and repressive policing puts both state forces and civilians at risk, as well as further stimulating the cycle of violence locally, increasing the “acceptable” norm for violent behaviour within society. The increasing use of militarized policing in the context of armed violence has been associated with growing unrest and death. Militarized policing and tactics such the implementation of “mandatory civil services for children” compromise the protection of children’s rights.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1148;"This paper describes children’s experiences of violence at home in Peru, using a life-course approach. Violence against children at home tended to increase with age, as children took on more chores (especially in rural areas), and spent more time away from home (in some cases, in urban areas). The chances of being hit by parents increased when children failed in their responsibilities; spending more time away from home also presented potential dangers for children (e.g., being robbed in the community, joining a gang, etc.), and so violence was used as a means to protect them and to prevent them from being led astray. We discuss how living in poverty affects relationships between parents and children. Meeting the basic economic needs of a family is the priority for parents, who then have limited time, energy and resources to devote to their children. We also found that children exposed to violence in the home are also frequently exposed to corporal punishment at school. Parents are often aware of this situation and support teachers to punish their children, because it is considered critical for children’s learning and education. Addressing violence affecting children requires a multi-level approach that incorporates not only measures to address the manifestations of violence affecting children, but also the underlying factors driving that violence.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1149;Illicit financial flows from developing countries make up a significant part of the larger problem of capital flight, reducing the resources available for investment, growth, and poverty reduction and resulting in significant losses in government revenue.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1150;This report provides an analysis of the impact of a range of corrupt practices on economic growth and development in four key sectors: utilities and infrastructure, extractive industries, health and education. As quantification of the impact of corruption on economic growth at a macro level remains challenging, this report presents evidence at the micro and sectoral level to capture the various consquences of this phenomenon. Prepared by the OECD as a contribution to the G20 efforts to fight corruption, this report aims at increasing the understanding of the channels by which corruption inhibits economic growth and assist countries in further integrating anticorruption in their efforts to foster inclusive, sustainable growth and development. Drawing lessons from the cross-cutting analysis, the report encourages countries to design comprehensive anti-corruption strategies for which progress could be measurable and which would be tailored to specific country circumstances and economies to achieve the best results for economic growth and value-for-money.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1151;This report looks at how governments can ensure that everyone has access to justice, and that justice processes and services are responsive to people’s needs. Based on lessons derived from people-centred service delivery, the report identifies access to justice principles and promising practices, as well as measurement tools and indicators to help countries monitor their progress. It sets out a framework for people-centred service design and delivery that can be applied to the entire legal and justice chain. Drawing on over five years of research and collaboration with OECD member countries and partner economies, the report contributes to our collective understanding of effective access to justice and the crucial role it plays in inclusive and sustainable growth and development.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1152;"In 2014, the United Nations, through the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (unodc), the Commission on Narcotic Drugs (cnd), the International Narcotics Control Board (incb) and the Commission on Crime Prevention and Criminal Justice (ccpcj), continued to strengthen international cooperation in countering transnational organized crime, corruption, drugs and international terrorism. Unodc provided technical assistance, legal advice and research to the main United Nations policymaking bodies in drug control and crime prevention, and assisted Member States in developing domestic legislation and in implementing the international drug control and crime prevention conventions. During the year, the Office improved the alignment between its strategic framework and the normative and technical cooperation services it provided, implemented 16 regional and country programmes; launched a new regional programme in support of the Caribbean Community Crime and Security Strategy; and strengthened cooperation at the regional level in the Sahel. The Office also expanded its global programmes supporting the ratification and implementation of the international conventions on drugs and crime and promoting UN standards and norms in crime prevention and criminal justice. It supported preparations for the high-level review conducted by cnd, strengthened its cooperation and coordination with other UN agencies, promoted the coherence of UN initiatives on the rule of law and amplified the impact of its work through cooperation with international organizations.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1153;Realizing the goal of peaceful, just and inclusive societies is still a long way off. In recent years, no substantial advances have been made towards ending violence, promoting the rule of law, strengthening institutions at all levels, or increasing access to justice. Millions of people have been deprived of their security, rights and opportunities, while attacks on human rights activists and journalists are holding back development. More countries are ramping up efforts to uncover human rights abuses and designing laws and regulations that foster more open and just societies. But much more work is needed to ensure that these mechanisms are implemented properly;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1154;"Corruption and the illicit transfer of funds out of developing countries can undermine sustainable development by reducing the resources available for essential public services, undermining a country’s capacity to attract investors and fuel the economy, and weakening the trust between citizen and state. As illicit flows are often transnational problems, all countries involved – whether developing or OECD – need to work together. This chapter reviews OECD country performance in tackling money laundering and bribery and in repatriating stolen assets. It looks at what could be done to close legal loopholes, strengthen political will and enforce more serious penalties for non-compliance. Development co-operation can also do more to help developing countries fulfil their own responsibilities, such as strengthening governance systems for detecting and reducing corruption; requesting asset repatriation; and bringing to justice those found guilty of corruption, theft of public resources and money laundering.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1155;"Progress on recovering and repatriating stolen assets to developing countries has been modest. OECD countries can do more to signal that asset recovery is a political priority and to put in place the necessary legal and institutional framework to repatriate assets. This means dedicating more resources to legal and technical expertise to handle complex and costly cases involving developing countries. It also means adopting legal best practice, such as allowing for rapid freezing of assets when requested to do so by a foreign jurisdiction; directly enforcing foreign confiscation orders; allowing for non conviction-based asset confiscation; recognising foreign non conviction-based forfeiture orders; allowing foreign countries to initiate civil actions in domestic courts; and where appropriate, allowing compensation, restitution or other damages to benefit a foreign jurisdiction. In turn, developing countries must make it a priority to engage in effective mutual legal assistance, provide the necessary information to investigating authorities with which they co-operate, and proactively pursue and sanction their nationals implicated in corruption cases";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1156;The study of why people kill other people is vital from a policy perspective, as without such knowledge it is very difficult to implement appropriate strategies and policies for the prevention and reduction of homicide. A number of homicide types can be identified on the basis of elements such as premeditation, motivation, context, instrumentality and perpetrator-victim relationship, which all play roles of varying magnitudes in different forms of homicide. That said, developing homicide typologies is a complex business, not least because they sometimes overlap and, in real life, homicide drivers can be multiple. Indeed, further research and methodological work is needed to help develop a comprehensive categorization of homicide, but some of its typologies, which are particularly relevant from the crime prevention perspective, can already be identified in the following manner;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1157;Over the past decades, leaders and citizens in many countries have lamented the lack of transparency in government and declining citizens’trust in government. South Korea is not an exception. In order to restore trust in government, the Korean government has made considerable efforts to adopt and promote various citizen participation programmes at all levels of government in an effort to ensure accountability, improve transparency and trust in government. This article first discusses the importance of citizen participation as a means of improving transparency and trust in government. It then introduces offline and online citizen participation programmes run by central agencies and local governments and highlight how those citizen participation programmes have evolved. As one specific form of citizen participation practice, this article focuses on the practice of Participatory Budgeting (PB) as an effort to enhance transparency and citizens’trust in government by opening its processes and disclosing budgeting information to the public. Most especially, this article reveals the results of a PB survey of local governments in Korea and discusses why and how PB has been adopted, implemented, and designed to improve budget-related governance structure, policy-making processes, and outputs such as efficiency, accountability, transparency, and trust in government. Lastly, this article discusses policy implications for enhancing public trust in government through PB.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1158;Article 30 contains extensive and multifaceted rules for adjudicating corruption offences. Its scope and density of context account for a significant number of challenges with regard to its implementation, reflecting the specificities and different priorities of national legal systems and making it one of the key provisions for putting into effect the criminalization measures of the Convention, and to some extent for the success of the Convention overall;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1159;"Review of SDG implementation and interrelations among goals Discussion on SDG 16 – Peace, justice and strong institutions Friday, 12 July 2019, 3:00 PM–6:00 PM, Conference Room 4 Background Note1 Introduction Sustainable development cannot be without peace and security; and peace and security will be at risk without sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda recognizes the need to build peaceful, just and inclusive societies that provide equal access to justice and that are based on respect for human rights, on effective rule of law and good governance at all levels and on transparent, effective and accountable institutions. SDG 16 – promoting peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, providing access to justice for all, and building effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels – has been identified at the Conference on SDG 16 as a Goal that is both an outcome and an enabler of sustainable development.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1160;SDG 16 is closely interlinked with other SDGs. Without peace, justice and inclusion, achieving goals such as ending poverty, ensuring education, promoting economic growth can be difficult or impossible. At the same time, various SDGs can help or hinder the achievement of SDG 16, for instance climate change can act as a threat multiplier, aggravating additional social, environmental and political stressors, conditions that could possibly lead to violence. 1 This background note has been prepared based on the SDG 16 Conference entitled “Peaceful, Just and Inclusive Societies: SDG 16 implementation and the path toward leaving no one behind” co-organized by the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs (UNDESA) and the International Law Development Organization (IDLO) with the Government of Italy - held in Rome, Italy from 27-29 May 2019. Progress towards SDG 16 is a universal challenge which requires action for implementation and follow up in both developing and developed countries, albeit in different ways. In many countries, capacity needs and gaps represent a critical barrier to meaningful SDG 16 implementation and follow-up. These capacity issues are often, though not exclusively, felt in countries that are post-conflict, transitioning out of conflict, fragile, or least developed. At the same time, in many developed and emerging countries (though again not exclusively so), violence against women and children continues to threaten their well-being and pose obstacles to realizing their full potential. Issues such as social cohesion, illicit financial flows, corruption and many forms of discrimination remain grave challenges.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1161;Member States and the international community need to do more in preventing and eradicating conflict, even as they support to improve lives of those living in conflict affected regions by reducing the drivers of violent conflict and improving ways to reach marginalized populations affected by conflict and making progress on the SDGs. As enshrined in SDG 16, the 2030 Agenda calls for transparent, effective, inclusive and accountable institutions to advance poverty eradication and sustainable development. It aims to ensure responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision-making at all levels. SDG 16 emphasizes the central role of institutions and effective decision-making in reaching the SDGs. As with the rest of the 2030 Agenda, while governments have a leading role to play, the achievement of SDG 16 depends on a whole-of-society approach. Civil society organizations are involved in multiple ways, as implementers and as advocates for underrepresented parts of the population such as women, youth and marginalized groups. For its part, the private sector can also make an important contribution to efforts towards peacebuilding, inclusion, advancing the rule of law and eliminating corruption as fundamental to creating an environment conducive to development where business can thrive. L;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1162;"Local governments, parliamentarians and the academia are other critical stakeholders in the implementation of SDG 16 and the 2030 Agenda as a whole. Status and trends2 Throughout the world, advances in ending violence, promoting the rule of law, strengthening institutions, and increasing access to justice are uneven. Millions of people live in insecurity and continue to be deprived of, rights and opportunities. Specific indicators associated with individual targets support this picture. ▪ Legal identity: Globally, 73% of children under 5 had their births registered; the proportion is less than half (46%) in sub-Saharan Africa. ▪ Homicides: The number of intentional homicides per 100,000 population ticked up from 6.0 in 2015 to 6.1 in 2017, largely as a result of an increase in the homicide rate in Latin America and the Caribbean and in some countries in sub-Saharan Africa. ▪ Violence against children: Nearly 8 in 10 children aged 1 to 14 years were subjected to some forms of psychological aggression and/or physical punishment on a regular basis at home in 83 countries (mostly from developing regions). ▪ Trafficking in persons: There has been an overall increase in the detection of victims of trafficking in persons. The vast majority (70%) of detected victims of human trafficking are females, most of whom were trafficked for sexual exploitation.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1163;▪ Prisoners held in detention: The share of unsentenced detainees in the overall prison population has remained largely constant at 30% in recent years. ▪ Freedom of information: Binding laws and policies giving individuals a right to access information held by public authorities have been adopted by 125 countries. Among the 123 countries for which data is available, 40 do not have a proper right 2 Data on status and trends in this section is referenced from the Report of the Secretary-General on Progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals 2019. to appeal to an independent administrative body, assessed as key for proper implementation of this right. ▪ Human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists: Killings of human rights defenders, journalists and trade unionists are on the rise. From 2017 to 2018, the UN recorded and verified 431 additional killings across 41 countries. ▪ National institutions: In 2018, only 39% of all countries had in place a National Human Rights Institution (NHRI) compliant with internationally agreed standards (the Paris Principles). Guiding questions;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;
1164;▪ What are the specific policy reforms, local actions and strategies adopted to support national and local processes to strengthen resilience of communities and institutions to best deliver on SDG16? These could include actions in the spheres of strengthening social cohesion, dialogue and reconciliation, access to basic services including justice and security and conflict/dispute resolution. ▪ How can SDG 16 targets and indicators leverage human rights norms, standards and analytical approaches to inform the measurement, monitoring and implementation of the 2030 Agenda? ▪ What are the key interventions and specific policies that can help reach the furthest behind first, especially those who are left behind due to violence, injustice, and exclusion? ▪ What are some of the primary and urgent capacity needs and gaps of governments and other stakeholder groups around SDG 16 and how can those gaps be filled? Do they differ from the longer-term capacity needs for the achievement of SDG 16? ▪ What innovative methodologies and partnerships, including the use of data, technology and expertise from the private sector, civil society and academia can be harnessed to strengthen national systems to track and report on progress related to targets under Goal 16? What tools and support do Member States require for strengthening disaggregated data availability?;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1;

1205;In 2015, net ODA from member countries of the Development Assistance Committee of OECD totalled $131.6 billion. Taking account of inflation and the rise in the value of the dollar in 2015, this was 6.9 per cent higher in real terms than in 2014, and represented the highest level ever reached. Total ODA from those countries as a share of their gross national income was 0.30 per cent, on par with 2014. Most of the increase was owing to higher expenditures for costs associated with refugees. However, even if those costs are excluded, ODA still rose by 1.7 per cent. Seven countries met the United Nations target for ODA of 0.7 per cent of gross national income in 2015: Denmark, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1206;Fixed-broadband services remain largely unaffordable and unavailable across much of the population in developing regions, highlighting digital divides in access to high-speed, high-capacity Internet services. By 2015, fixed-broadband penetration had reached 29 per cent in developed regions, but only 7.1 per cent and 0.5 per cent, respectively, in developing regions and the least developed countries. Major disparities are also found in Internet use. In developing regions, one third of the population is online versus 1 in 10 people in the least developed countries. Data also reveal that more men than women are online. In 2015, globally, the Internet user penetration rate was about 11 per cent lower for women than for men. The gender gap is even higher in developing regions (15 per cent) and highest in the least developed countries (29 per cent).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1207;"Net ODA for capacity-building and national planning amounted to $23 billion in 2014; of that total, sub-Saharan Africa received $6 billion and Southern and Central Asia received $4.6 billion. The main sectors receiving assistance were public administration, environment and energy, which together were allocated a total of $9.3 billion.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1208;The weighted average of applied tariffs has been decreasing over time, but still varies widely across regions and country groups on main product sectors. Average agricultural tariffs on imports coming into Asia, for instance, are the highest in the world, at around 27 per cent for Southern Asia and 20 per cent for Eastern Asia in 2015, under most-favoured nation status.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1209;In 14 years, the least developed countries’ share in world merchandise exports nearly doubled, from 0.6 per cent in 2000 to 1.1 per cent in 2014. The key driver of export growth during that period was a massive rise in the price of fuel, ores and metals, reflecting a high demand in developing countries, notably China. In services, the least developed countries increased their share of world exports to 0.8 per cent in 2014 ($40 billion), up from 0.5 per cent in 2005.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1210;The requirements of the indicators developed in the context of the Millennium Development Goals have fostered stronger national statistical plans and systems. The number of countries with a national statistical plan increased in some regions between 2010 and 2015, including in sub-Saharan Africa and the least developed countries. However, the overall number of plans declined from 56 to 54 among the countries being observed, since the time period of some existing plans expired.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1211;Financial support for statistical capacity amounted to $325 million in 2013, compared with $379 million in 2010. However, assistance to the least developed countries, in this regard, tripled during the period and reached $265 million. Despite an increasing awareness of the importance of statistics for evidence-based policymaking and development, the share of ODA dedicated to statistics hovered at around 0.3 per cent between 2010 and 2013.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1212;Population and housing censuses are a primary source of the disaggregated data needed for formulating, implementing and monitoring development policies and programmes. During the 10-year period spanning from 2006 to 2015, 90 per cent of countries or areas around the world conducted at least one population and housing census.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1213;"Over the period 2005-2014, birth registration data were available for 183 out of 230 countries or areas, whereas death registration data were available for 157. Only 58 per cent of developing countries with available data have birth registration coverage of 90 per cent or more; 71 per cent of developing countries with available data have death registration coverage of 75 per cent or more. Sub-Saharan Africa has the lowest levels of complete birth and death registration.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1214;The average overall rate of taxation among the Group of 20 and other advanced economies was around 23 per cent of GDP in 2018, compared with 18 per cent among the developing and emerging market economies. Assessing an appropriate level of “tax burden” (revenue in the form of taxes) is a critical element of fiscal policy with implications for economic growth.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1215;At the end of 2018, more than half the world’s population (3.9 billion people) had access to the Internet – a step towards a more inclusive global information society. Over 80 per cent in developed countries were online in 2018, compared with 45 per cent in developing countries and only 20 per cent in least developed countries.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1216;Total ODA for capacity-building and national planning stood at $33.5 billion in 2017, representing 14 per cent of total sector-allocable aid – a level that has been stable since 2010. The main sectors assisted were public administration, energy and the financial sector, which received a combined total of $13.0 billion. Latin America and the Caribbean enjoyed the largest share of aid at $7.6 billion, followed by sub-Saharan Africa ($6.1 billion) and South Asia ($5.0 billion).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1217;"Patronage is the support, encouragement, privilege, or financial aid that an organization or individual bestows to another. In the history of art, arts patronage refers to the support that kings, popes, and the wealthy have provided to artists such as musicians, painters, and sculptors. It can also refer to the right of bestowing offices or church benefices, the business given to a store by a regular customer, and the guardianship of saints. The word ""patron"" derives from the Latin: patronus (""patron""), one who gives benefits to his clients (see Patronage in ancient Rome).\nIn some countries the term is used to describe political patronage, which is the use of state resources to reward individuals for their electoral support. Some patronage systems are legal, as in the Canadian tradition of the Prime Minister to appoint senators and the heads of a number of commissions and agencies; in many cases, these appointments go to people who have supported the political party of the Prime Minister. As well, the term may refer to a type of corruption or favoritism in which a party in power rewards groups, families, or ethnicities for their electoral support using illegal gifts or fraudulently awarded appointments or government contracts.'),
 ('Financial_transaction',
  'A financial transaction is an agreement, or communication, carried out between a buyer and a seller to exchange an asset for payment.\nIt involves a change in the status of the finances of two or more businesses or individuals. The buyer and seller are separate entities or objects, often involving the exchange of items of value, such as information, goods, services, and money. It is still a transaction if the goods are exchanged at one time, and the money at another. This is known as a two-part transaction: part one is giving the money, part two is receiving the goods.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1218;Trade involves the transfer of goods or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a market.\nAn early form of trade, barter, saw the direct exchange of goods and services for other goods and services. Barter involves trading things without the use of money.  When either bartering party started to involve precious metals, these gained symbolic as well as practical importance. Modern traders generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as money. As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or earning. The  invention of money (and later of credit, paper money and  non-physical money) greatly simplified and promoted trade.  Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade, while trade involving more than two traders is called multilateral trade.\nIn one modern view, trade exists due to specialization and the division of labor, a predominant form of economic activity in which individuals and groups concentrate on a small aspect of production, but use their output in trades for other products and needs. Trade exists between regions because different regions may have a comparative advantage (perceived or real) in the production of some trade-able commodity—including production of natural resources scarce or limited elsewhere. For example: different regions' sizes may encourage mass production. In such circumstances, trade at market prices between locations can benefit both locations.\nRetail trade consists of the sale of goods or merchandise from a very fixed location (such as a department store, boutique or kiosk), online or by mail, in small or individual lots for direct consumption or use by the purchaser. Wholesale trade is defined as traffic in goods that are sold as merchandise to retailers, or to industrial, commercial, institutional, or other professional business users, or to other wholesalers and related subordinated services.\nHistorically, openness to free trade substantially increased in some areas from 1815 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Trade openness increased again during the 1920s, but collapsed (in particular in Europe and North America) during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Trade openness increased substantially again from the 1950s onwards (albeit with a slowdown during the oil crisis of the 1970s). Economists and economic historians contend that current levels of trade openness are the highest they have ever been.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1219;"Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM), previously Science, mathematics, engineering, and technology (SMET), is a term used to group together these academic disciplines. This term is typically used when addressing education policy and curriculum choices in schools to improve competitiveness in science and technology development. It has implications for workforce development, national security concerns and immigration policy. The science in STEM typically refers to two out of the three major branches of science: natural sciences, including biology, physics, and chemistry; and formal sciences, of which mathematics is an example, along with logic and statistics. The third major branch of science, social science such as: psychology, sociology, and political science, are categorized separately from the other two branches of science, and are instead grouped together with humanities and arts to form another counterpart acronym named HASS - Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. Psychology however is considered a major part of STEM, besides the other 2 subjetcs. In the United States/ United Kingdom education system, in elementary, middle, and high schools, the term science refers primarily to the natural sciences, with mathematics being a standalone subject, and the social sciences are combined with the humanities under the umbrella term social studies.\nThe change was, in part, instigated at an interagency meeting by Peter Faletra the director from the Office of Science division of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists. The acronym was adopted by Rita Colwell and other science administrators in the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2001. However , the acronym STEM predates NSF which was used by a variety of educators including Charles E. Vela, the founder and director of the Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Education (CAHSEE).  In the early 1990s, CAHSEE started a summer program for talented under-represented students in the Washington, DC area called the STEM Institute.  Based on the program's recognized success and his expertise in STEM education, Charles Vela was asked to serve on numerous NSF and Congressional panels in science, mathematics and engineering education; it is through this manner that NSF was first introduced to the acronym STEM.  One of the first NSF projects to use the acronym was STEMTEC, the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Teacher Education Collaborative at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, which was founded in 1998 true to its word.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1220;"Technology (""science of craft"", from Greek τέχνη, techne, ""art, skill, cunning of hand""; and -λογία, -logia) is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems (e.g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system\'s use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems.\nThe simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the available sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, including the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a global scale.\nTechnology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies (including today\'s global economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth\'s environment. Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.\nPhilosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1221;"Engineering is the use of scientific principles to design and build machines, structures, and other items, including bridges, tunnels, roads, vehicles, and buildings. The discipline of engineering encompasses a broad range of more specialized fields of engineering, each with a more specific emphasis on particular areas of applied mathematics, applied science, and types of application. See glossary of engineering.\nThe term engineering is derived from the Latin ingenium, meaning ""cleverness"" and  ingeniare, meaning ""to contrive, devise";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1222;Applied science is the application of existing scientific knowledge to practical applications, like technology or inventions.\nWithin natural science, disciplines that are basic science develop basic information to \npredict and perhaps explain and understand phenomena in the natural world. Applied science is the use of scientific processes and knowledge as the means to achieve a particular practical or useful result. This includes a broad range of applied science related fields, including engineering and medicine.\nApplied science can also apply formal science, such as statistics and probability theory, as in epidemiology. Genetic epidemiology is an applied science applying both biological and statistical methods.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1223;"Finance is a term for matters regarding the management, creation, and study of money and investments.\nSpecifically, it deals with the questions of how and why an individual, company or government acquires the money needed - called capital in the company context - and how they spend or invest that money.  Finance is then often split per the following major categories:  corporate finance, personal finance and public finance.At the same time, and correspondingly, finance is about the overall ""system""\n \n-  i.e.  the financial markets that allow the flow of money, via investments and other financial instruments,  between and within these areas; \nthis ""flow"" is facilitated by the financial services sector.\nA major focus within finance is thus investment management — called money management for individuals, and asset management for institutions — and finance then includes the associated activities of securities trading & stock broking, investment banking, financial engineering, and risk management.  \nGiven its wide scope, finance is studied in several academic disciplines, \nand, correspondingly, there are several related professional qualifications that can lead to the field.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1224;A partnership is an arrangement where parties, known as business partners, agree to cooperate to advance their mutual interests. The partners in a partnership may be individuals, businesses, interest-based organizations, schools, governments or combinations. Organizations may partner to increase the likelihood of each achieving their mission and to amplify their reach. A partnership may result in issuing and holding equity or may be only governed by a contract;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1225;Mexico is committed to the promotion of international development co-operation and its effectiveness to achieve global and national goals.

1226;This Working Paper summarises the main findings and recommendations of the pilot study carried out in Costa Rica as part of the development of the total official support for sustainable development (TOSSD) measurement framework. The Paper includes first approximations of TOSSD flows to Costa Rica. These flows in 2016 amount to around USD 559 million of official development finance and USD 60 million of private finance mobilised through official development interventions. These first estimations were reached using OECD DAC statistics. However, these figures are likely to be largely underestimated owing to a lack of available information, particularly concerning official support to Costa Rica from the People’s Republic of China and other non-DAC providers. The pilot study also indicated that the government is able to access, collect, collate, analyse and use data on external financing to the country using national data, thanks to its institutional and IT systems. However, the legislative framework requires adjustment and there is scope for improving co‑ordination in order to avoid duplication of effort.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1227;This study provides new insights into factors that enable effective triangular co-operation. These include sound national ecosystems to support triangular partnerships through high-level political will, guiding documents, institutional structures, partnerships, resources and management procedures. Furthermore, against the background of the 2030 Agenda and the outcomes of BAPA+40, a shift of thinking from ‘donor-recipient’ relations to ‘partnerships’ needs to run through political discourse, public opinion, strategies and systems of all partners in triangular co-operation. Moreover, for the first time, the issue of ‘transaction costs’ in triangular co-operation is discussed systematically. Based on the research, interviews, and meetings that were conducted for this study, broad agreement emerged that these are investments in the partnership, and should not be regarded as costs. Finally, five options to engage effectively in triangular co-operation are offered. The decision for one of these five approaches, depends on the specific context of the partners that wish to set up new triangular co-operation initiatives. There is no one-size-fits-all approach, thus this study aims to contribute ideas and policy implications based on existing experiences and evidence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1228;"In 2015, the international policy community made a marked shift away from framing the world as donors versus recipients, to embrace a shared development agenda. With conflict‑ and climate-driven crises reminding us of our interconnectedness, this repositioning was well overdue. It’s time for the funding design for our global agenda to match this shift. Financing for sustainable development is not a cost; it is an investment. Rather than a static web of providers and receivers, today’s ecosystem of financing for sustainable development (FSD) should be seen as a dynamic market, with providers competing to respond to global demands. Healthy competition will help to drive innovation, better tailor financing to the needs of developing countries, and promote higher social and economic returns.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1229;"the Addis Ababa Action Agenda envisions the development process and the mobilization of the corresponding financial means along the following lines: countries have a responsibility to lead the national development process; countries should have national ownership of development; countries need to mobilize the resources required to finance the process; and the international community commits to supporting countries in their development, including with regard to its financing. The Agenda states that “cohesive nationally owned sustainable development strategies, supported by integrated national financing frameworks, will be at the heart of our efforts” and reiterates that “each country has primary responsibility for its own economic and social development” (United Nations, 2015b, para. 9). The Agenda thus implies a central role for States in steering the pursuit of the Sustainable Development Goals and in the mobilization of the financing required to provide the investment and current spending needed to achieve the Goals. Domestically, key elements in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda include capable Governments and public institutions, real partnerships and the formulation of country- specific plans and road maps to achieve the Goals and uphold long-term sustainability. This raises the question of the capacity of States to take on the responsibilities assigned to them.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1230;"Triangular co-operation features in the 2030 Agenda and the Addis Ababa Action Agenda as an instrument to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. It combines the comparative advantages of the different partners involved, creates synergies, promotes learning among all partners and builds relationships based on trust. However, several myths have developed about triangular co-operation projects 1) being small in scale and scope, operating only in niche areas; 2) lacking systematic planning and implementation mechanisms; and 3) having no clear value added. This report addresses these three “myths” by analysing the results from a survey of triangular co-operation that the OECD conducted in 2015. It provides evidence on the “reality” from over 400 projects that were reported by the 60 respondents. The report concludes that triangular co-operation is a highly relevant and strategic mode of co-operation with increasing numbers of projects, budgets and durations, established planning mechanisms and a clear value added.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1231;he ENEA subregion is one of the most dynamic parts of the world, with countries that have achieved noteworthy economic growth and made significant contributions to development cooperation. The development experiences in North-East Asian countries, their varying development assistance approaches and close geographical and cultural proximity offer practical and valuable lessons to share with developing countries, particularly among the aid recipients in the Asia-Pacific region.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1232;This chapter includes information on the estimated volume and key features of the development co-operation provided by ten providers that are not members of the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) and which are among the largest providers of development co-operation, including OECD priority partners. The OECD estimates the volume of their programme based on official government reports, complemented by web-based research (mainly on contributions to multilateral organisations).;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1233;ome countries in East and North-East Asia (ENEA)1 have come to play an increasingly important role in foreign aid regimes over the past couple of decades. They are key providers of development assistance, and their development experiences and strategies continue to shape the landscape of development cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1234;"Development cooperation has been traditionally identified closely with aid through ODA. In this section, the changing global and regional landscape is considered from the aspects of: (a) the scale and source of financial flows as reported to the Development Assistance Committee (DAC) of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD); and (b) the emergence of new forms and players in development assistance. The discussion includes development assistance beyond the definition of ODA.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1235;In addition to the need for better measures of finance for sustainable development, policies need to be designed in a way that can deliver the ambition of an integrated Addis Ababa Action Agenda. The trillions required to finance the Sustainable Development Goals are present in the global economy. However, a focus on smarter policy design to shift the trillions is needed to make the best use of existing resources and strengthen the development footprint of different actors. This means minimising leakages and maximising catalytic effects in support of sustainable development. Competition in the form of more suppliers and instruments is increasing within the financing sustainable development market, which calls for better policy guidance and coherence mechanisms to manage the risks and seize opportunities. Although sustainable and inclusive growth is primarily a domestic agenda, tackling global inequalities and poverty reduction, addressing potential shocks, and delivering on international commitments in support of the global goals cannot be achieved without stronger international solidarity and co-operation among countries and actors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1236;Azerbaijan is an emerging provider of development co-operation, though it still receives official development assistance (ODA). With a new national development strategy, Azerbaijan no longer depends on foreign assistance. Azerbaijan has a comparative advantage in sharing its expertise in various fields of development, such as effective public service delivery, education, labour and social protection, youth empowerment, mine action and others. Since 2011, almost 90 countries benefited from the aid provided by Azerbaijan. In order to provide timely and co-ordinated international assistance, the Azerbaijan International Development Agency (AIDA) was established in 2011 under the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Azerbaijan. AIDA also develops and implements international assistance projects.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1237;Belgium’s policy for development co-operation prioritises least developed countries (LDCs) and fragile states. In addition to tackling fragility, other policy priorities include a stronger focus on private sector development, climate change, digital for development and human rights-based approaches. Belgium’s priority countries are evolving in line with its focus on fragility: since 2015, six middle-income countries have been removed from the list of priority countries, while two fragile states have been added.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1238;"In April 2017, Slovenia’s National Assembly adopted the new International Development Co-operation of the Republic of Slovenia Act. This act is complemented by a September 2017 Resolution, a November 2018 Decree, and a December 2018 strategy on development cooperation and humanitarian assistance, which maintain Slovenia’s geographical priorities in the Western Balkans, the European neighbourhood and least developed countries (LDCs) in sub-Saharan Africa, with a specific focus on Montenegro and North Macedonia. The Resolution identifies two thematic priorities: 1) promoting peaceful and inclusive societies; and 2) sustainable management of natural and energy resources and the fight against climate change. It reaffirms Slovenia’s commitment to allocating at least 10% of its bilateral official development assistance (ODA) to humanitarian assistance. As mentioned in the 2017 DAC Peer Review, Slovenia is preparing an action plan to gradually increase ODA to 0.33% of gross national income (GNI) by 2030. This action plan is still under inter-ministerial co-ordination.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1239;Each actor and type of finance for sustainable development has its own comparative advantages, costs and benefits. The wide range and variety of financing actors suggests new opportunities to diversify between and combine financing sources to increase their contribution to sustainable development. In an ideal world, actors would be well informed about these strengths and weaknesses, enabling them to strategically exploit each source to meet the financing needs of Agenda 2030.This Chapter provides an overview of features and factors that increase the diversity of financing available, but also increase the complexity of financing choices. The Chapter outlines the different instruments available, as well as the way a country’s income level affects the financing options it faces. Finally, the Chapter surveys some of the complex interactions between actors and financing sources. These three elements – instruments, income levels, and interactions – reinforce the need for a coherent, holistic approach across actors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1240;LDC specificities and long-standing challenges in financing investments for sustainable development have been extensively documented and are widely acknowledged, at least in principle, by the international community. Nonetheless, concrete responses have so far fallen short of the needs of LDCs, as well as of the internationally agreed commitments enshrined in the Sustainable Development Goals and, previously, in the Millennium Development Goals. Chapter 1 explained how sluggish economic diversification and weak development of domestic productive capacities in most LDCs converge, creating a structural deficit in a country’s current account and, consequently, little ability to attract market-based forms of sustainable long-term financing. Notwithstanding some incipient signs of improvement, the interplay of these factors leaves many LDCs with limited alternatives to ODA as a source of external finance, leading to heightened levels of aid dependence.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1241;In 2014, the United Nations continued to review how its development operations should be situated in the evolving post-2015 development agenda, including in the context of the quadrennial comprehensive policy review (qcpr) of operational activities for development in the UN system. Several UN entities had aligned their strategic plans with qcpr in timing and content, but progress was uneven in areas related to the coherent and effective functioning of the UN development system. During its operational activities for development segment, the Economic and Social Council held a high-level dialogue on the changing landscape of development cooperation, and adopted a resolution calling for wider implementation of qcpr. In December, the General Assembly adopted resolutions that affirmed that UN operational activities for development should make a key contribution to the objectives of the post-2015 development agenda, and invited UN development entities, in collaboration with national and international stakeholders, to support efforts to strengthen the capacity of Member States in the evaluation of development activities.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1242;"A follow-up to the 2015 OECD Social Impact Investment (SII) report, this publication brings new evidence on the role of SII in financing sustainable development. It depicts the state of play of SII approaches globally, comparing regional trends, and assesses its prospects, with a special focus on data issues and recent policy developments. It provides new guidance for policy makers and providers of development co-operation to maximise the contribution of impact investing to delivering the 2030 Agenda, the Paris Agreement as well as the Addis Ababa Action Agenda. To that end, it calls for an “impact imperative” in financing for sustainable development in terms of: ensuring financing is going where it is needed most; applying innovative new approaches to solving the Sustainable Development Goals; addressing data and measurement challenges; and evaluating the ex post social, environmental and economic results of public initaitives.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1243;"Financing the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in developing countries is a major challenge. Three years after the Addis Ababa Action Agenda (AAAA) in 2015 called on all actors - public and private - to co-ordinate better and mobilise more financial resources, the outlook is not encouraging: external finance - which many developing countries continue to depend on heavily - has been going down, largely due to the drop in private flows, and co-ordination remains poor. The trend must be reversed: financing the sustainable development of poor countries is an investment in the well-being of all nations. OECD countries must face the challenge: urgent and bold action is needed to implement the AAAA with their partners and fulfil the promise of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development at home and abroad. Mobilising more finance for developing countries is not enough; the quality – i.e. the “sustainable development footprint”– of all finance must be enhanced. This Overview chapter synthesises the report's diagnosis and its recommendations for reforms in three areas: (i) better measurement of the quantity and quality of finance for the SDGs; (ii) better incentives to direct the finance already available globally to the SDGs; and (iii) better co-ordination of actors to connect the supply and demand for financing for sustainable development in developing countries.";;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1244;The role of the private sector remains controversial in development cooperation, yet it is increasingly being solicited. The architecture of ODA is evolving, as donors seek alternative sources of development finance to fund the ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development and to supplement dwindling levels of ODA. Donors’ private sector engagement strategies prioritize a toolbox of financial instruments to support private investment in a variety of developing country contexts, including in LDCs. This move has revolutionized the definition of ODA and its purpose.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1245;The universal, transformative and inclusive agenda defined by the new Sustainable Development Goals means that the need to co-operate and work effectively is more urgent than ever. Partnerships are the way forward for effective development. This overview chapter of the Development Co-operation Report 2015 proposes a new, multi-level system of accountability to guide effective partnerships in implementing and monitoring work to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals. It defines three core functions of partnerships that are central to the successful implementation of the new goals: accountability, co-ordinated action and knowledge sharing. Drawing lessons from 5 concept chapters and 11 diverse case stories of partnerships from around the world, it defines a framework for effective post-2015 coalitions for action based on 10 success factors.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
1246;The Global Partnership for Development Effectiveness is already helping to build a holistic, inclusive and action-oriented post-2015 development framework. From its inclusive governance structure to its role in creating a space for exchange among the full range of development actors, it is proving to be particularly effective as a transformative tool on the ground. This chapter outlines some of its practical achievements to date, which include tracking progress on the implementation of the development effectiveness principles, organising a widely attended high-level forum in Mexico, and supporting nearly 40 practical initiatives to enhance development effectiveness around the world.This chapter also includes an opinion piece by Lilianne Ploumen, Dutch Minister for Foreign Trade and Development Co-operation and one of three Co-Chairs of the Global Partnership.;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;1
