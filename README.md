# SDG_Meter 

A myriad of textual documents produced/consumed by UNEP need to be mapped to SDGs (project proposals, reports, briefings, etc). Such mapping exercises demand extensive expert time and rely on personal knowledge of interlinkages among topics and SDGs. While UNEP counts with experts in several topics, interlinkages with SDGs outside our expertise can be missed out. 

That's why we propose an automatic text classification which for a given text permits to establish relationships with the SDGs treats in the text but also quantifies the degree to which the text belongs to each of the detected SDGs.

Our repositiory contains : 

- (1) Our entire solution code is avilable in the Jupyter Notebook file "SDG_Meter_BERT_Algorithm.ipynb" but also is Python script file .py
- (2) Initial/short database "SDG_Objectives.csv" in CSV format
- (3) All the process/algorithm/API we used to clean and improve the orignal database "Database_conception_BERT.ipynb"
- (4) The final database obtained thanks to steps in (3) "res.csv" in CSV format
- (5) All the recquired packages for your environment (obtained via pip freeze) "


We also provide all the process/algorithm/API we used to clean and improve the orignal database
