190;This paper reports on trends in life expectancy in the 28 EU and some other high- , and examines potential explanations for the slowdown in improvements in recent years. The slowdown in improvements in life expectancy since 2011 has been greatest in the USA, where life expectancy has fallen in recent years, and the UK, but France, Germany, Sweden and Netherlands have seen a sharp slowdown. Overall, the pace of mortality improvement has slowed in several EU and Australia and Canada since 2011. Diseases of older ages are major contributors to the slowdown. Improvements in cardiovascular (CVD) disease mortality have slowed in many , respiratory diseases, influenza and pneumonia, have claimed excess lives in some winters, and deaths from dementia and Alzheimer's disease are rising. In some , notably the USA and the UK, mortality improvements have slowed or even reversed working age adults because of the rising numbers dying from drug-related accidental poisoning. The report considers wider contributing factors. Although some risk factors, such as smoking, excessive alcohol consumption, high blood pressure and cholesterol levels, continue to decline in most EU , the prevalence of obesity and diabetes continues to rise. Adverse trends in inequalities could have an impact if some population groups experience lower gains in longevity than others, thereby reducing the overall gain. Looking ahead, it is unclear whether the current slowdown in mortality improvements in some EU and the USA is a long-term trend or not, whether the slowdown in major killers such as CVD will persist, and whether or not the excess winter mortality seen in some years becomes a regular feature given population ageing and increasing numbers of frail, older . The timely monitoring and investigation of mortality trends, through international collaboration where possible, can facilitate early implementation of remedial strategies.;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

This term is typically used when addressing education and curriculum choices in schools to improve competitiveness in science and technology development. It has implications for workforce development, security concerns and immigration . The science in STEM typically refers to two out of the three major branches of science: natural sciences, biology, physics, and chemistry; and formal sciences, of which mathematics is an example, along with logic and statistics. The third major branch of science, social science such as: psychology, sociology, and political science, are categorized separately from the other two branches of science, and are instead grouped together with humanities and arts to form another counterpart acronym named HASS - Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences. Psychology is considered a major part of STEM, besides the other 2 subjetcs. In the United States/ United Kingdom education system, in elementary, middle, and high schools, the term science refers primarily to the natural sciences, with mathematics being a standalone subject, and the social sciences are combined with the humanities under the umbrella term social studies.\nThe change was, in part, instigated at an interagency meeting by Peter Faletra the director from the Office of Science division of Workforce Development for Teachers and Scientists. The acronym was adopted by Rita Colwell and other science administrators in the National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2001. , the acronym STEM predates NSF which was used by a variety of educators Charles E. Vela, the founder and director of the Center for the Advancement of Hispanics in Science and Engineering Education (CAHSEE). In the early 1990s, CAHSEE started a summer program for talented under-represented students in the Washington, DC area called the STEM Institute. Based on the program's recognized success and his expertise in STEM education, Charles Vela was asked to serve on numerous NSF and Congressional panels in science, mathematics and engineering education; it is through this manner that NSF was first introduced to the acronym STEM. One of the first NSF projects to use the acronym was STEMTEC, the Science, Technology, Engineering and Math Teacher Education Collaborative at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, which was founded in 1998 true to its word.";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1

More specifically, it investigates the extent to which structural have differential long-run impacts on GDP per capita and on household incomes at different points of the distribution. One aim is to verify whether policy decisions may face tradeoffs between objectives of economic efficiency and equity. Many growth enhancing structural reforms are found to deliver stronger income gains for households at the lower end of the distribution compared with the average household, an indication that they may reduce inequality in disposable incomes. Such is the case of reducing regulatory barriers to domestic competition as as to trade and FDI; stepping-up job-search support and activation programmes. Conversely, other reforms involve trade-offs between the efficiency and equity objective. This is the case of the tightening of unemployment benefits for the long-term unemployed, which is found to lift GDP per capita and average household incomes, but to reduce disposable incomes at the lower end of the distribution.";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

610;Childhood malnutrition remains a significant health concern. In order to implement effective policies to the issue, it is crucial to first understand the mechanisms underlying malnutrition. This paper uses a unique dataset from Northern Ghana to explain the underlying causes of childhood malnutrition. It adopts an empirical framework to model inputs in the production of health and nutrition, as a function of child, household and community characteristics. The findings suggest that child characteristics are important in explaining inputs and nutritional outcomes, and that maternal agency and health contribute to improved health status. Household resources in the form of consumption are positively associated with food intake and nutritional outcomes. Simulations show that income growth, improving maternal care and avoiding sudden price shocks have a positive but rather limited effect on the reduction of malnutrition. Effects are greater in under two. Hence, policies that underlying determinants simultaneously, and target the youngest population of , could have the largest effect on reducing malnutrition in this population.;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

783;"In physics, energy is the quantitative property that must be transferred to an object in order to perform work on, or to heat, the object. Energy is a conserved quantity; the law of conservation of energy states that energy can be converted in form, but not created or destroyed. The SI unit of energy is the joule, which is the energy transferred to an object by the work of moving it a distance of 1 metre against a force of 1 newton.\nCommon forms of energy include the kinetic energy of a moving object, the potential energy stored by an object's position in a force field (gravitational, electric or magnetic), the elastic energy stored by stretching solid objects, the chemical energy released when a fuel burns, the radiant energy carried by light, and the thermal energy due to an object's temperature.\nMass and energy are closely related. Due to mass–energy equivalence, any object that has mass when stationary (called rest mass) has an equivalent amount of energy whose form is called rest energy, and any additional energy (of any form) acquired by the object above that rest energy will the object's total mass just as it increases its total energy. For example, after heating an object, its in energy could be measured as a small in mass, with a sensitive enough scale.\nLiving organisms require energy to stay alive, such as the energy humans get from food. Human civilization requires energy to function, which it gets from energy resources such as fossil fuels, nuclear fuel, or renewable energy.

In the history of art, arts patronage refers to the support that kings, popes, and the wealthy have provided to artists such as musicians, painters, and sculptors. It can also refer to the right of bestowing offices or church benefices, the business given to a store by a regular customer, and the guardianship of saints. The word ""patron"" derives from the Latin: patronus (""patron""), one who gives benefits to his clients (see Patronage in ancient Rome).\nIn some the term is used to describe political patronage, which is the use of state resources to reward individuals for their electoral support. Some patronage systems are legal, as in the Canadian tradition of the Prime Minister to appoint senators and the heads of a number of commissions and agencies; in many cases, these appointments go to people who have supported the political party of the Prime Minister. As well, the term may refer to a type of corruption or favoritism in which a party in power rewards groups, families, or ethnicities for their electoral support using illegal gifts or fraudulently awarded appointments or government contracts.'), ('Financial_transaction', 'A financial transaction is an agreement, or communication, carried out between a buyer and a seller to exchange an asset for payment.\nIt involves a change in the status of the finances of two or more businesses or individuals. The buyer and seller are separate entities or objects, often involving the exchange of items of value, such as information, goods, services, and money.

805;The future of the ’s population is urban. With more than half of the ’s people living in urban areas (55 per cent, up from 30 per cent in 1950), urbanization determines the spatial distribution of the ’s population and is one of the four demographic mega-trends, with the of the population, population ageing, and migration. Estimates and projections of urbanization introduced in this report indicate that the future of the human population can be accounted for almost entirely by a growing of city dwellers. By mid-century, roughly two thirds (68 per cent) of the ’s population will be living in urban areas. The urban population is projected to grow by 2.5 urban dwellers between 2018 and 2050, with nearly 90 per cent of the increase concentrated in Asia and Africa. In regions, the share of population living in cities, as as the and size of cities, will continue to grow, driven by a combination of factors, a surplus of births over deaths in urban areas, migration from rural to urban areas and from abroad (Lerch, 2017) as as the urbanization of formerly rural areas.

According to the widely used Food and Agriculture Organization definition, forests 4 billion hectares (9.9×109 acres) (15 square miles) or approximately 30 percent of the 's land area in 2006.Forests are the dominant terrestrial ecosystem of Earth, and are distributed around the globe. Forests account for 75% of the gross primary production of the Earth's biosphere, and contain 80% of the Earth's plant biomass. Net primary production is estimated at 21.9 gigatonnes carbon per year for tropical forests, 8.1 for temperate forests, and 2.6 for boreal forests.Forests at different latitudes and elevations form distinctly different ecozones: boreal forests around the poles, tropical forests around the Equator, and temperate forests at the middle latitudes. Higher elevation areas tend to forests similar to those at higher latitudes, and amount of precipitation affects forest composition.\nHuman society and forests influence each other in both positive and negative ways. Forests provide ecosystem to humans and serve as tourist attractions. Forests can affect people's health.

SDG 13 on climate change is particularly pertinent to the future survival of biodiversity and the health of the ecosystems on which it vitally depends.

894;"Saving is income not spent, or deferred consumption. Methods of saving include putting money aside in, for example, a deposit account, a pension account, an investment fund, or as cash. Saving also involves reducing expenditures, such as recurring costs. In terms of personal finance, saving generally specifies low-risk preservation of money, as in a deposit account, versus investment, wherein risk is a lot higher; in economics more broadly, it refers to any income not used for immediate consumption. Saving does not automatically include interest. \nSaving differs from savings. The former refers to the act of not consuming one\'s assets, whereas the latter refers to either multiple opportunities to reduce costs; or one\'s assets in the form of cash. Saving refers to an activity occurring over time, a flow variable, whereas savings refers to something that exists at any one time, a stock variable. This distinction is often misunderstood, and even professional economists and investment professionals will often refer to ""saving"" as ""savings"".In different contexts there can be subtle differences in what counts as saving. For example, the part of a person\'s income that is spent on mortgage loan principal repayments is not spent on present consumption and is therefore saving by the above definition, even though people do not always think of repaying a loan as saving. However, in the U.S. measurement of the numbers behind its gross national product (i.e., the National Income and Product Accounts), personal interest payments are not treated as ""saving"" unless the and people who receive them save them.\nSaving is closely related to physical investment, in that the former provides a source of funds for the latter.";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Water is linked to many activities, and there are complex channels through which water . The purpose of this report is to provide background information useful for a quantitative assessment of the impact of water scarcity on using a multi-region, recursive-dynamic, Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model. The paper provides a detailed review of the literature on water, water scarcity, sectoral activity and , and identifies the possibilities and bottlenecks in incorporating water use into a CGE framework. It covers agricultural water consumption, with special attention to irrigation, water use in energy production, and demands for water by households, industry and . Finally, it discusses water supply and allocation. Based on the evidence assembled, there appear to have been relatively few instances in which water scarcity has significantly slowed the long term rate of national . Furthermore, in reviewing the literature on water demand, the ample opportunities for conserving water across the board are striking, in the electric power , the production of industrial steam, residential consumption, and irrigated agriculture. In our opinion, the main reason why such substitution has not been more widespread to date is due to the absence of incentives for conservation. The presence of large inter-sectoral distortion heightens the for general equilibrium analysis. But implementation of a CGE model with detailed representation of water demand and supply will be a significant undertaking. It is to break out water from the other inputs in the CGE model, treat water as both an input and an output, and add sectoral detail, with special attention to crop irrigation. Furthermore, there are in assigning appropriate values to water and specifying allocation rules for dealing with water scarcity.;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

However, entrenched acceptance of discriminatory social norms, legal loopholes and inadequate support for working parents undermine gender equality. Although women’s educational attainment now matches men’s, fewer than half of working-age Mexican women are in the labour force. Nearly 60% of Mexico’s working women hold informal jobs, with little social protection and low pay. Mexico’s adolescent pregnancy rate remains five times as high as the , and the share of young women not in employment, education or training is nearly four times the rate for young men.

The argument has been made that public interventions may be justified by the economy-wide gains to be had from loss or waste reduction (the economic case), as as its potential contribution to improved food security and nutrition or environmental sustainability. This discusses the types of public interventions that can reduce food losses or waste, not as a goal in themselves but rather as a means towards wider social or environmental goals. The scarcity of reliable data as to how much and where food is lost or wasted, and the lack of information regarding the costs of reduction efforts, are a major obstacle to the formulation of effective for loss or waste reduction.

The breakdown of the Gini coefficient at a detailed level of policy instruments enables us to identify the main channels of income inequality reduction and shows how these results differ . Our results for Chile and Mexico suggest that fiscal policy benefits the poorest income groups, mainly through in-kind services such as education and health care. Nevertheless, when compared with outcomes in high-income , the effectiveness of fiscal policy in reducing inequality is still limited.

To measure up to the challenge, the country has undertaken a series of reforms, starting with a landmark law passed in 1996. The reforms have succeeded in setting the stage for a new approach to healthcare based on primary care.

Important barriers to wider use remain, with providers and patients facing regulatory uncertainty, patchy financing and reimbursement, and vague governance. Due to inequalities in health and digital literacy, patients that most stand to benefit are often those that are least able to and make use of telemedicine.

1104;Ensuring energy security and addressing cost-effectively are key global . Tackling these will require efforts from stakeholders worldwide. To find , the public and sectors must work together, sharing burdens and resources, while at the same time multiplying results and outcomes. Through its broad range of multilateral initiatives (Implementing Agreements), the IEA enables member and non-member , businesses, industries, organisations and non-governmental organisations to research on breakthrough technologies, to fill existing research gaps, to build pilot plants and to carry out deployment or demonstration programmes across the energy sector. In short, their work can comprise any -related activity that supports energy security, growth, environmental protection and engagement worldwide. Some 40 Implementing Agreements carry out programmes in the areas of energy (buildings, electricity, industry, and transport), fossil fuels (clean coal, enhanced oil recovery, carbon capture and storage), fusion power (tokamaks, materials, technologies, safety, alternate concepts) and renewable energy technologies, and cross-cutting topics ( transfer, research databases, and modeling). This publication highlights the most significant recent achievements of the IEA Implementing Agreements. The core of the IEA Energy Technology Network, these initiatives are a fundamental building block for facilitating the entry of new and energy technologies into the marketplace.;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

1117;However, today, 33 percent of land is moderately to highly degraded, and conditions are getting worse in far more cases than they are improving. An estimated two-thirds of the population – over 4 billion – live in areas with severe water shortages for at least one month each year, and a growing number of regions are facing water scarcity due to excessive water use in agriculture. Groundwater is being depleted, polluted, or salinized in ways disproportionately affecting the poor and vulnerable. The extent of wetlands is estimated to have declined between 64-71% in the 20th century, and wetland losses and degradation continue worldwide. Agricultural greenhouse gas emissions from crop and livestock production grew by 14 percent between 2001 and 2011. It is estimated that 20-25 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions are directly caused by agriculture, including deforestation. In return, higher temperature and increased climate variability and weather- disasters affect agriculture and threaten the stability of food prices. Smallholder farmers in developing are the most at risk, as their sensitivity to extreme events is usually low.

Partnerships and knowledge sharing are critical to drive positive change. Countries are progressively integrating principles of sustainability in their agriculture policies and programmes. The 2030 Agenda offers line agencies an opportunity to look at agriculture through the lens of the multiple economic, social and environmental functions it performs, and to develop tools and incentives that balance trade-offs between the different dimensions of sustainability.

Target 2.5 Maintaining genetic diversity Biodiversity is key to food and nutrition, and to ensuring increases in agricultural production. Genetic resources provide the material for selection on higher productivity and lower use of chemical inputs, resulting in less depletion of natural resources.

To this end, we estimate poverty elasticities relative to income and inequality, specifying two dynamic econometric models estimated via the generalized method of moments (GMM) system developed by Arellano and Bond (1991), Arellano and Bover (1995) and Blundell and Bond (1998). The model-estimated results prompt the conclusion that the income growth effect on poverty is smaller when the initial level is low. The same is found when the initial inequality level is high.

1438;"Consumerism is a social and economic order that encourages an acquisition of goods and services in ever-increasing amounts. With the industrial revolution, but particularly in the 20th century, mass production led to overproduction—the supply of goods would grow beyond consumer demand, and so manufacturers turned to planned obsolescence and advertising to manipulate consumer spending. In 1899, a book on consumerism published by Thorstein Veblen, called The Theory of the Leisure Class, examined the widespread values and economic institutions emerging with the widespread ""leisure time"" in the beginning of the 20th century. In it Veblen ""views the activities and spending habits of this leisure class in terms of conspicuous and vicarious consumption and waste.

1495;Biodiversity loss is a major environmental challenge facing humankind. Despite some local successes, biodiversity is on the decline globally and this loss is projected to continue. Continuing with business as usual may have far-reaching adverse implications for human well-being, security and economic growth. This summarises the considerable and often hidden values of biodiversity and the ecosystems of which it is a part. It then looks at trends in several indicators of biodiversity – species abundance (e.g. mean species abundance or MSA), threatened species, forest area (deforestation) and marine fish stocks – and the implications of business-as-usual trends continuing to the year 2050 under the OECD Environmental Outlook Baseline scenario. The provides an overview of the different instruments available for biodiversity conservation and sustainable use, ranging from regulations to market-driven , such as payments for ecosystem (PES). Some more ambitious scenarios are examined – such as the implications of meeting the Aichi Biodiversity Target under the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) to expand the protected area network to at least 17% of terrestrial land by 2020.

It includes the combination of the various , agencies, entities, decision-making processes and patterns of consumption that comprise the economic structure of a given community. As such, an economic system is a type of social system. The mode of production is a related concept. All economic systems have three basic questions to ask: what to produce, how to produce and in what quantities, and who receives the output of production.\nThe study of economic systems includes how these various agencies and are linked to one another, how information flows between them and the social relations within the system ( property rights and the structure of management). The analysis of economic systems traditionally focused on the dichotomies and comparisons between market economies and planned economies and on the distinctions between capitalism and socialism. Subsequently, the categorization of economic systems expanded to include other topics and models that do not conform to the traditional dichotomy.

Improving agricultural productivity has been a core strategy for economic and alleviation for several decades, as this type of productivity was thought to facilitate structural transformation, which enables “surplus agricultural labour” to find employment in nonagricultural sectors. However, it has now been realized that the share of agriculture in national output declines more rapidly than the share of agricultural employment in total employment, trapping millions in “unproductive” agriculture and making them relatively poorer. Understanding this process and identifying appropriate responses is critical for alleviation and inclusive growth. Based on data analysis and reviews, in the present paper, it has been found that structural transformation processes are incomplete in many developing . Reducing rural and promoting inclusive growth cannot be realized by confining to agriculture, but instead they can be achieved by seeking a broader framework that facilitates enhanced intersectoral linkages.;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

1669;By not using income to buy consumer goods and services, it is possible for resources to instead be invested by being used to produce fixed capital, such as factories and machinery. Saving can therefore be vital to increase the amount of fixed capital available, which contributes to economic growth.\nHowever, increased saving does not always correspond to increased investment. If savings are not deposited into a financial intermediary such as a bank, there is no chance for those savings to be recycled as investment by business. This means that saving may increase without increasing investment, possibly causing a short-fall of demand (a pile-up of inventories, a cut-back of production, employment, and income, and thus a recession) rather than to economic growth. In the short term, if saving falls below investment, it can lead to a growth of aggregate demand and an economic boom. In the long term if saving falls below investment it eventually reduces investment and detracts from future growth. Future growth is made possible by foregoing present consumption to increase investment. However savings not deposited into a financial intermediary amount to an (interest-free) loan to the government or central bank, who can recycle this loan.\nIn a primitive agricultural economy savings might take the form of holding back the best of the corn harvest as seed corn for the next planting season.

To shed some lights on the potential sources of trade-offs between growth and equity, this investigates the long-run impact of structural reforms on household incomes the distribution, hence on income inequality. The builds on a macro-micro approach by combining recent macro-level estimates of the impact of structural reforms on macroeconomic growth with micro-level estimates of the impact of structural reforms on household incomes the income distribution. It considers the sources of macroeconomic growth, by decomposing growth in GDP per capita into growth in labour utilisation and labour productivity. This allows for shedding light on the mechanisms through which growth and its drivers, policy drivers, benefit household incomes at different points of the income distribution. Most structural reforms are found to have little impact on income inequality when the latter is assessed through measures that emphasise the middle class. By contrast, a higher number of structural reforms, in social protection reforms, are found to have an impact on income inequality and thus may raise tradeoffs and synergies between growth equity objectives when inequality is assessed through measures that emphasise relatively more incomes the poor.

Non-mandatory education is mostly provided by the private sector in Japan, which imposes a significant financial burden on households. Financial support for students is of limited scope, which potentially reduces the efficiency of resource allocation and raises equity concerns.

There are many methods for measuring economic inequality, with the Gini coefficient being a widely used one. Another type of measure is the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index, which is a statistic composite index that takes inequality into account.

Pedagogy, taken as an academic discipline, is the study of how knowledge and skills are imparted in an educational context, and it considers the interactions that take place during learning. Both the theory and practice of pedagogy vary greatly, as they reflect different social, political, and cultural contexts.Pedagogy is often described as the act of teaching. The pedagogy adopted by teachers shapes their actions, judgments, and other teaching strategies by taking into consideration theories of learning, understandings of students and their needs, and the backgrounds and interests of individual students. Its aims may range from furthering liberal education (the general of potential) to the narrower specifics of vocational education (the imparting and acquisition of specific skills). Conventional western pedagogies view the teacher as knowledge holder and student as the recipient of knowledge (described by Paulo Freire as ""banking methods""), but theories of pedagogy increasingly identify the student as an agent and the teacher as a facilitator.\nInstructive strategies are governed by the pupil\'s background knowledge and experience, situation, and environment, as well as learning goals set by the student and teacher.

1923;"Innovation in its modern meaning is ""a new idea, creative thoughts, new imaginations in form of device or method"". Innovation is often viewed as the application of better solutions that meet new requirements, unarticulated needs, or existing market needs. Such innovation takes place through the provision of more-effective products, processes, services, technologies, or business models that are made available to markets, and society. An innovation is something original and more effective and, as a consequence, new, that ""breaks into"" the market or society. Innovation is related to, but not the same as, invention, as innovation is more apt to involve the practical implementation of an invention (ie new / improved ability) to make a meaningful impact in the market or society, and not all innovations require an invention. Innovation often manifests itself via the engineering process, when the problem being solved is of a technical or scientific nature. The opposite of innovation is exnovation.\nWhile a novel device is often described as an innovation, in economics, management science, and other fields of practice and analysis, innovation is generally considered to be the result of a process that brings together various novel ideas in such a way that they affect society. In industrial economics, innovations are created and found empirically from services to meet growing consumer demand.Innovation has an older historical meaning which is quite different. From the 1400s through the 1600s, prior to early American settlement, the concept of ""innovation"" was pejorative.

It does so by measuring the extent to which RFMOs apply best practices against IUU fishing and pointing to the remaining gaps. Information gathered from RFMOs’ resolutions and recommendations introducing conservation and measures (CMMs), other publicly available sources and direct communication with RFMOs’ secretariats was analysed and summarised into five indicators reflecting the most important tools targeting IUU fishing at the disposal of RFMOs. Indicators show overall progress among RFMOs, but discrepancies remain, suggesting scope for improvement by learning from best performers.;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0

2168;Manufacturing is the production of products for use or sale using labor and machines, tools, chemical or biological processing or formulation, and is the essence of secondary industry. The term may refer to a range of human activity from handicraft to tech but is most commonly applied to industrial design, in which raw materials from primary industry are transformed into finished goods on a large scale. Such finished goods may be sold to other manufacturers for the production of other more complex products (such as aircraft, household appliances, furniture, sports equipment or automobiles), or distributed via the tertiary industry to end users and consumers (usually through wholesalers, who in turn sell to retailers, who then sell them to individual customers).\nManufacturing engineering or manufacturing process are the steps through which raw materials are transformed into a final product. The manufacturing process begins with the product design, and materials specification from which the product is made. These materials are then modified through manufacturing processes to become the required part.\nModern manufacturing includes all intermediate processes required in the production and integration of a product's components. Some industries, such as semiconductor and steel manufacturers use the term fabrication instead.\nThe manufacturing sector is closely connected with engineering and industrial design. Examples of major manufacturers in North America include General Motors Corporation, General Electric, Procter & Gamble, General Dynamics, Boeing, Pfizer Precision Castparts And FCA. Examples in Europe include Volkswagen Group, Siemens, FCA and Michelin. Examples in Asia include Toyota, Yamaha, Panasonic, LG, Samsung and Tata Motors.;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

2207;Historically low productivity gains and record high inequality are major challenges for policy makers around the world. Both concerns have been exacerbated by the global financial crisis but took roots well before and reflect fundamental challenges with the way our economies function. This report proposes a new comprehensive approach to promote better productivity performance and reduce inequalities. It not only gathers the most recent evidence on the main factors behind slowing productivity gains and rising or persisting inequalities but also suggests possible common foundations and linkages between these two trends. It stresses the risk of a vicious cycle setting in, where individuals with fewer skills and poorer access to opportunities are confined to unproductive and often precarious jobs. This reduces aggregate productivity and widens inequality. The report focuses on how to expand the productive assets of an economy by investing in the skills of its people and providing an where all firms have a fair chance to succeed, in lagging regions.

Many legal scholars and authors have explained that a person may be both a lawyer and a jurist, but a jurist is not necessarily a lawyer, nor a lawyer necessarily a jurist. Both must possess an acquaintance with the term ""law"". The work of the jurist is the study, analysis and arrangement of the law—work which can be done wholly in the seclusion of the library.

2453;A city is a large human settlement. It can be defined as a permanent and densely settled place with administratively defined boundaries whose members work primarily on non- tasks. Cities generally have extensive systems for housing, transportation, sanitation, utilities, land use, and communication. Their density facilitates interaction between people, government organisations and businesses, sometimes benefiting different parties in the process, such as improving efficiency of goods and service distribution. This concentration can have significant negative , such as forming urban heat islands, concentrating pollution, and stressing supplies and other resources.\nHistorically, city-dwellers have been a small proportion of humanity overall, but following two centuries of and rapid urbanisation, roughly half of the population now lives in cities, which has had profound for sustainability. Present-day cities usually form the core of larger metropolitan areas and urban areas—creating numerous commuters traveling towards city centres for employment, entertainment, and edification. However, in a of globalisation, all cities are to varying degrees connected globally beyond these regions. This increased influence means that cities have significant influences on issues, such as development, warming and health.\nOther important traits of cities besides population include the capital status and relative continued occupation of the city. For example, country capitals such as Abu Dhabi, Beijing, Berlin, Cairo, London, Moscow, Paris, Rome, Seoul, Tokyo, Taipei, and Washington, D.C. reflect their nation's identity. Some historic capitals, such as Kyoto, maintain their reflection of cultural identity even without modern capital status. Religious holy sites offer another example of capital status within a religion, Jerusalem, Mecca, and Varanasi each hold . The cities of Faiyum, Damascus, and Argos are among those laying claim to the longest continual inhabitation. In terms of relative age, the oldest cities in the Americas are Cholula near Puebla, Florés in Petén, and Acoma near Albuquerque, while the oldest capital cities in the Americas are Mexico City, Santo Domingo, and San Juan. Another example of relative age, is in the age of the oldest capital cities of the superpower and emerging superpower, they are the U.S. state capital of Santa Fe, New Mexico, and the Chinese prefecture capital of Xi'an, Shaanxi.;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

2808;Production is a process of combining various material inputs and immaterial inputs (plans, know-how) in order to make something for consumption (output). It is the act of creating an output, a good or service which has and contributes to the utility of individuals. The area of economics that focuses on production is referred to as production theory, which in many respects is similar to the consumption (or consumer) theory in economics.Economic -being is created in a production process, meaning all economic activities that aim directly or indirectly to satisfy human wants and . The degree to which the are satisfied is often accepted as a measure of economic -being. In production there are two features which explain increasing economic -being. They are improving quality-price-ratio of goods and services and increasing incomes from growing and more efficient market production or total production which help in increasing GDP.\nThe most important forms of production are:\n\nmarket production\npublic production\nhousehold productionIn order to understand the origin of economic -being, we must understand these three production processes. All of them produce commodities which have and contribute to -being of individuals.\nThe satisfaction of originates from the use of the commodities which are produced. The need satisfaction increases when the quality-price-ratio of the commodities improves and more satisfaction is achieved at less cost. Improving the quality-price-ratio of commodities is to a producer an essential way to improve the competitiveness of products but this kind of gains distributed to customers cannot be measured with production data. Improving the competitiveness of products means often to the producer lower product prices and therefore losses in incomes which are to be compensated with the of sales volume.\nEconomic -being also increases due to the of incomes that are gained from the growing and more efficient market production. Market production is the only production form which creates and distributes incomes to stakeholders. Public production and household production are financed by the incomes generated in market production. Thus market production has a double role in creating -being, i.e. the role of producing goods and services and the role of creating income. Because of this double role market production is the “primus motor” of economic -being and therefore here under review;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0

3076;The discussion on improving disciplines on fisheries subsidies and making a contribution towards fishing and managing fisheries has been ongoing at the World Trade Organization (WTO) since the WTO Doha Ministerial Conference held in 2001. In 2005, the WTO Hong Kong Ministerial Declaration gave a mandate on negotiations on fisheries subsidies aimed at strengthening disciplines on fisheries subsidies and prohibiting certain forms of subsidies that lead to overcapacity and over-fishing. Small vulnerable economies (SVEs) have strongly been involved in these discussions, particularly in view of the implications for their economies of the threat of certain forms of fisheries subsidies to the sustainability of fishing. Negotiations on fisheries subsidies have intensified as WTO members seek an outcome at the 11th Ministerial Conference (MC11). To participate meaningfully in the negotiations, SVEs have to identify issues of interest to them and ensure that they are captured in the outcome at MC11. This briefing paper assesses the current proposals on the negotiating table to determine whether or not they take into account the interests of SVEs. It concludes by suggesting strategic options on how SVEs can structure approaches to negotiations on strengthening disciplines on subsidies in the fisheries sector.;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0

The monitoring framework of SDG 15 does not yet capture essential elements related to quality that are crucial for more meaningful results, pointing to the need for additional indicators in areas such as forest intactness, effectiveness of protected areas, and meaningful integration of biodiversity into other processes. No indicator exists yet to measure the integration of ecosystem and biodiversity values into planning; it is likely that a future indicator will be based on self-assessments of progress towards targets, possibly with a rating system to provide a degree of standardization. Beyond understanding how reaching targets all the SDGs will accelerate progress toward SDG 15 in more integrated ways, the challenge now is to apply this understanding to the and actions that will have transformative effects, to create sustainable and resilient societies.

The impact of energy measures can go far beyond energy savings, and energy can be an important contributor to growth and social . Benefits attributed to the implementation of energy measures range from localised benefits, such as energy affordability, health, wellbeing and social , to sectoral benefits, such as industrial productivity, asset values and reduced environmental damage. Macroeconomic outcomes such as national competitiveness, jobs, consumer surplus and energy security, as well as poverty alleviation and greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation in both developed and , are further associated with energy measures. Significant evidence is emerging on the extent to which these outcomes stem from energy . At the same time, evaluation experts are beginning to explore ways to quantify them so that they can be more readily assessed alongside energy savings. Expanding evaluation to such matters could offer a new perspective on energy measures and, by improving the cost/benefit assessment of energy programs, could help decision-makers reconcile perceived trade-offs between supporting growth and reducing energy use.

3163;"Climate is the long-term average of weather, typically averaged over a period of 30 years. Some of the meteorological variables that are commonly measured are temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, wind, and precipitation. In a broader sense, climate is the state of the components of the climate system, which includes the ocean and ice on Earth. The climate of a location is affected by its latitude, terrain, and altitude, as as nearby water bodies and their currents.\nMore generally, the ""climate"" of a region is the general state of the climate system at that location at the time.\nClimates can be classified according to the average and the typical ranges of different variables, most commonly temperature and precipitation. The most commonly used classification scheme was the Köppen climate classification. The Thornthwaite system, in use since 1948, incorporates evapotranspiration along with temperature and precipitation information and is used in studying biological diversity and how climate change affects it. The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region.\nPaleoclimatology is the study of ancient climates. Since very few direct observations of climate are available before the 19th century, paleoclimates are inferred from proxy variables that include non-biotic evidence such as sediments found in lake beds and ice cores, and biotic evidence such as tree rings and coral. Climate models are mathematical models of past, present and future climates. Climate change may occur over long and short timescales from a variety of factors; recent warming is discussed in warming. Global warming results in redistributions. For example, ""a 3°C change in mean annual temperature corresponds to a shift in isotherms of approximately 300–400 km in latitude (in the temperate zone) or 500 m in elevation. Therefore, species are expected to move upwards in elevation or towards the poles in latitude in response to shifting climate zones""";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0

Actions for implementation directly affect the lives and wellbeing of many indigenous peoples and local communities often viewed as excluded, marginalized or at risk of being left behind. Status and Trends3 Progress toward SDG 15 is mixed. At the level, there is progress along indicators related to actions (e.g. numbers of protected areas), but indicators related to status (e.g. IUCN Red List numbers and state of species) are still negative. The average proportion of sites for biodiversity by protected areas to increase—as of January 2018, the average proportion of each Key Biodiversity Area (KBA) for freshwater, terrestrial and mountain biodiversity by protected areas was 44 per cent, 47 per cent and 48 per cent, respectively. Yet biodiversity to be lost at an accelerated rate, largely due to human activities. Changes in species extinction risk are measured by the Red List Index, which incorporates data on more than 20,000 animal and plant species, indicating an increasing risk of extinction for species as the index moves toward zero. Since 1993, the Red List Index has declined from 0.82 to 0.74 globally. The primary drivers of this biodiversity loss are habitat loss from unsustainable agriculture, deforestation, unsustainable harvest and , and alien invasive species.

In contrast, agriculture that relies only on direct rainfall is referred to as rain-fed.\nIrrigation systems are used for cooling livestock, dust suppression, disposal of sewage, and in mining. Irrigation is often studied together with drainage, which is the removal of surface and sub-surface water from a given area.\n\nIrrigation has been a feature of agriculture for over 5,000 years and is the product of many cultures.

3542;"In politics, humanitarian aid, and social science, hunger is a condition in which a person, for a sustained period, is unable to eat sufficient food to meet basic nutritional needs. So in the field of hunger relief, the term hunger is used in a sense that goes beyond the common desire for food that all humans experience.\nThroughout history, portions of the \'s population have often suffered sustained periods of hunger. In many cases, hunger resulted from food supply disruptions caused by war, plagues, or adverse weather. In the decades following World War II, technological progress and enhanced political cooperation suggested it might be possible to substantially reduce the number of suffering from hunger. While progress was uneven, by 2015 the threat of extreme hunger subsided for many of the \'s population. According to figures published by the FAO in 2019 however, the number of suffering from chronic hunger has been increasing over the last four years. This is both as a percentage of the \'s population, and in absolute terms, with about 821 afflicted with hunger in 2018.\nWhile most of the \'s hungry continue to live in Asia, much of the increase in hunger since 2015 occurred in Africa and South America. The FAO\'s 2017 report discussed three principal reasons for the recent increase in hunger: climate, conflict, and economic slowdowns. The 2018 report focused on extreme weather as a primary driver of the increase in hunger, finding rises were especially severe in where the agricultural were most sensitive to extreme variations in weather. While the FAO\'s 2019 report found there was a strong correlation between increases in hunger and that had suffered an economic slowdown.\nMany thousands of organisations are engaged in the field of hunger relief; operating at local, national, regional or levels. Some of these organisations are dedicated to hunger relief, while others may work in a number of different fields. The organisations range from multilateral institutions, to national governments, to local initiatives such as independent soup kitchens. Many participate in umbrella networks that connect together thousands of different hunger relief organisations. At the level, much of the \'s hunger relief efforts are coordinated by the UN, and geared towards achieving the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal for ""Zero hunger""";0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

3663;This chapter reviews policies to strengthen Germany’s productivity growth and prepare for changes in labour markets brought about by new technologies. The chapter also how social protection and the bargaining framework should be reformed for the future of work. Germany enjoys a relatively high labour productivity level but productivity growth has been modest in recent years. There is room to boost productivity growth by accelerating the diffusion of new technologies throughout the economy. Vigorous entrepreneurship and innovation by small and medium enterprises are key for such technology diffusion while strong broadband and mobile networks widen the scope of data-intensive technologies that can be exploited to increase productivity. Widespread use of new technologies will bring about changes in skill demand and work arrangements. As in many , Germany saw a decline in the share of middle-skilled jobs in employment. A relatively high share of jobs is expected to be automated or undergo changes in task contents as a result of technological change. New technologies are also likely to increase individuals engaging in new forms of work, such as gig work intermediated by digital platforms.

Early theories of justice were set out by the Ancient Greek philosophers Plato in his work The Republic, and Aristotle in his Nicomachean Ethics. Throughout history various theories have been established. Advocates of divine command theory argue that justice issues from God. In the 1600s, theorists like John Locke argued for the theory of natural law. Thinkers in the social contract tradition argued that justice is derived from the mutual agreement of everyone concerned. In the 1800s, utilitarian thinkers including John Stuart Mill argued that justice is on the best outcomes for the greatest of . Theories of distributive justice concern what is to be distributed, between whom they are to be distributed, and what is the proper distribution. Egalitarians argued that justice can only exist within the coordinates of equality. John Rawls used a social contract argument to show that justice, and especially distributive justice, is a form of fairness. Property rights theorists (like Robert Nozick) take a consequentialist view of distributive justice and argue that property rights- justice maximizes the overall wealth of an economic system. Theories of retributive justice are concerned with punishment for wrongdoing.

3705; Portugal’s export performance over the past decade has been impressive, helping to reduce external imbalances. This partly owed to a sequence of structural reforms that benefited the productivity of the export sector and led to an increase in its size. Nonetheless, exports as a share of GDP and the stock of foreign direct investment remain below that of other comparable small European economies. Further shifting the orientation of the economy to the external sector is vital for Portugal given the strong link between trade openness and GDP per capita. To do this, policymakers must ensure that policy settings incentivise exporting firms to expand and improve their competitiveness, both through lower price and improved quality. For example, regulatory barriers that reduce competition in professional services should be lowered to improve the price and quality of intermediate inputs. Increasing the efficiency of domestic is also key, especially through competition- reforms to the port sector. To further differentiate and improve Portuguese export products, skills in the business sector need to be enhanced through better-targeted lifelong learning opportunities. At the same time, there is a need to focus innovation policies on raising the participation of small and medium enterprises in innovative activities.;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

3722;Trade involves the transfer of goods or services from one person or entity to another, often in exchange for money. Economists refer to a system or network that allows trade as a market.\nAn early form of trade, barter, saw the direct exchange of goods and services for other goods and services. Barter involves trading things without the use of money. When either bartering party started to involve precious metals, these gained symbolic as well as practical importance. Modern traders generally negotiate through a medium of exchange, such as money. As a result, buying can be separated from selling, or earning. The invention of money (and later of credit, paper money and non-physical money) greatly simplified and promoted trade. Trade between two traders is called bilateral trade, while trade involving more than two traders is called multilateral trade.\nIn one modern view, trade exists due to specialization and the division of labor, a predominant form of economic activity in which individuals and groups concentrate on a small aspect of production, but use their output in trades for other products and needs. Trade exists between regions because different regions may have a comparative advantage (perceived or real) in the production of some trade-able commodity— production of natural resources scarce or limited elsewhere. For example: different regions' sizes may encourage mass production. In such circumstances, trade at market prices between locations can benefit both locations.\nRetail trade consists of the sale of goods or merchandise from a very fixed location (such as a department store, boutique or kiosk), online or by mail, in small or individual lots for direct consumption or use by the purchaser. Wholesale trade is defined as traffic in goods that are sold as merchandise to retailers, or to industrial, commercial, institutional, or other professional business users, or to other wholesalers and related subordinated services.\nHistorically, openness to free trade substantially increased in some areas from 1815 to the outbreak of World War I in 1914. Trade openness increased again during the 1920s, but collapsed (in in Europe and North America) during the Great Depression of the 1930s. Trade openness increased substantially again from the 1950s onwards (albeit with a slowdown during the oil crisis of the 1970s).

3858;Poverty is not having enough material possessions or income for a person's needs. Poverty may include social, economic, and political elements.\nAbsolute poverty is the complete lack of the means necessary to meet personal needs, such as food, clothing, and shelter. The threshold at which absolute poverty is defined is always about the same, independent of the person's permanent location or era.\nOn the other hand, relative poverty occurs when a person cannot meet a minimum level of living standards, compared to others in the same time and place. Therefore, the threshold at which relative poverty is defined varies from one country to another, or from one society to another. For example, a person who cannot afford housing better than a small tent in an open field would be said to live in relative poverty if almost everyone else in that area lives in modern brick homes, but not if everyone else lives in small tents in open fields (for example, in a nomadic tribe).\nGovernments and non-governmental organizations try to poverty. Providing needs to people who are unable to earn a sufficient income can be hampered by constraints on government's ability to deliver services, such as corruption, tax avoidance, debt and loan conditionalities and by the brain drain of health care and educational professionals. Strategies of increasing income to make needs more affordable typically include welfare, economic freedoms and providing financial services.;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

The second sub-dimension, agro-food system capacity, assesses rural infrastructure capacity, highlighting irrigation, labour mobility, skills and education. The third sub-dimension, agro-food system regulation, describes how well regulations for inputs and natural resources safeguard public safety and how burdensome it is for farmers to comply with them. The final sub-dimension, the agricultural innovation system, assesses the research and frameworks to create new technologies and the extension services to support farmers in adopting them.

Food insecurity and malnutrition are problems affecting rural areas in particular, as part of a pattern of deep-rooted spatial inequalities. Conventional sectoral agriculture and food policies often overlook such territorial disparities and, consequently, are unlikely to suffice to meet the goal of ending hunger and achieving food for all by 2030. This chapter argues that food and nutrition policies would greatly benefit from a territorial approach. A territorial approach to food and nutrition goes beyond a simple rural-urban dichotomy. The of strong and mutually reinforcing rural-urban linkages is important for the of agriculture and food at large, but will not be effective if it does not consider competing uses for land, water and other natural resources and plans infrastructure and basic services within and between different territorial contexts.;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

In of key Convention decisions, numerous mechanisms and partnerships have emerged, the Landscapes for People, Food and Nature partnership, the UN-REDD Programme6 and the Global Partnership on Forest and Landscape Restoration.7 The latter is supporting governments, the private , local communities and others in their efforts to achieve the “Bonn Challenge”: as of May 2018, 47 have pledged to have more than 160 hectares of degraded forests and landscapes under active restoration by 2020,8 with a view to scale up to 350 hectares by 2030.;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0

3940;Marine pollution occurs when harmful effects result from the entry into the ocean of chemicals, particles, industrial, agricultural and residential waste, noise, or the spread of invasive organisms. Eighty percent of marine pollution comes from land. Air pollution is a contributing factor by carrying off pesticides or dirt into the ocean. Land and air pollution have proven to be harmful to marine life and its habitats.The pollution often comes from nonpoint sources such as agricultural runoff, wind-blown debris, and dust. Pollution in large bodies of water can be aggravated by physical phenomena like the biological effects of Langmuir circulation. Nutrient pollution, a form of water pollution, refers to contamination by excessive inputs of nutrients. It is a primary cause of eutrophication of surface waters, in which excess nutrients, usually nitrates or phosphates, stimulate algae growth. Many potentially toxic chemicals adhere to tiny particles which are then taken up by plankton and benthic animals, most of which are either deposit feeders or filter feeders. In this way, the toxins are concentrated upward ocean food chains. Many particles combine chemically in a manner highly depletive of oxygen, causing estuaries to become anoxic.\nWhen pesticides are incorporated into the marine ecosystem, they quickly become absorbed into marine food webs. Once in the food webs, these pesticides can cause mutations, as as diseases, which can be harmful to humans as as the entire food web. Toxic metals can be introduced into marine food webs. These can cause a change to tissue matter, biochemistry, behaviour, reproduction, and suppress growth in marine life. Also, many animal feeds have a high fish meal or fish hydrolysate content. In this way, marine toxins can be transferred to land animals, and appear later in meat and dairy products.\nIn order to protect the ocean from marine pollution, policies have been internationally. There are different ways for the ocean to get polluted, therefore there have been multiple laws, policies, and treaties put into place throughout history.;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0

Preventing contact with feces is part of sanitation, as is hand washing with soap. Sanitation systems aim to protect by providing a clean environment that will stop the transmission of disease, especially through the fecal–oral route. For example, diarrhea, a main cause of malnutrition and stunted in children, can be reduced through sanitation. There are many other diseases which are easily transmitted in communities that have low of sanitation, such as ascariasis (a type of intestinal worm infection or helminthiasis), cholera, hepatitis, polio, schistosomiasis, and trachoma, to name just a few.\nA range of sanitation technologies and approaches exists. Some examples are community-led total sanitation, container-based sanitation, ecological sanitation, emergency sanitation, environmental sanitation, onsite sanitation and sanitation. A sanitation system includes the capture, storage, transport, treatment and disposal or reuse of excreta and wastewater. Reuse activities within the sanitation system may focus on the nutrients, water, energy or organic matter contained in excreta and wastewater. This is referred to as the ""sanitation value chain"" or ""sanitation economy"". The responsible for cleaning, maintaining, operating, or emptying a sanitation technology at any step of the sanitation chain are called ""sanitation workers"".Several sanitation """" are being used to compare sanitation within or across .

4049;Marine life, or sea life or ocean life, is the plants, animals and other organisms that live in the salt water of the sea or ocean, or the brackish water of coastal estuaries. At a fundamental level, marine life affects the nature of the planet. Marine organisms produce oxygen and sequester carbon. Shorelines are in part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even help create new land. The term marine comes from the Latin mare, meaning sea or ocean.\nMost life forms evolved initially in marine habitats. By volume, oceans provide about 90 percent of the living space on the planet. The earliest vertebrates appeared in the form of fish, which live exclusively in water. Some of these evolved into amphibians which spend portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Other fish evolved into land mammals and subsequently returned to the ocean as seals, dolphins or whales. Plant forms such as kelp and algae grow in the water and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. Plankton forms the general foundation of the ocean food chain, particularly the phytoplankton which are key primary producers.\nMarine invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in poorly oxygenated waters, including breathing tubes as in mollusc siphons. Fish have gills instead of lungs, although some species of fish, such as the lungfish, have both. Marine mammals, such as dolphins, whales, otters, and seals need to surface periodically to breathe air.\nThere are over 200,000 documented marine species with perhaps two million marine species yet to be documented. Marine species range in size from the microscopic, including phytoplankton which can be as as 0.02 micrometres, to huge cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises), including the blue whale – the largest known animal reaching 33 metres (108 ft) in length. Marine microorganisms, including protists, bacteria and viruses, constitute about 70% of the total marine biomass.;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0

A given economy is the result of a set of processes that involves its culture, values, education, technological evolution, history, social organization, political structure and legal systems, as well as its geography, natural resource endowment, and ecology, as main factors. These factors give context, content, and set the conditions and parameters in which an economy functions. In other words, the economic domain is a social domain of human practices and transactions.

Economic transactions occur when two groups or parties agree to the value or price of the transacted good or service, commonly expressed in a certain currency.

4356;Against a backdrop of the widening income distribution in most , OECD governments need to formulate policies that support sustainable and economic growth. Tax policies play a crucial role in this endeavour. Both tax theory and mounting evidence suggest that many could achieve both higher and more broadly shared income growth. Many , however, seem hesitant to fundamentally restructure their tax systems to achieve higher and more growth. This reluctance begs a key question: Why forego tax policy reforms that hold the obvious promise of win-win outcomes of both higher and more growth? To offer some concrete answers to this question, this paper reports the findings of a synthesis of cross-country work on the ranking (in terms of efficiency and distributional impact) of major tax instruments on the one hand, and, on the other, country-specific tax policy assessments reported in several dozen OECD Economic Surveys since 2008. The paper identifies a wide range of factors, some common to many and some country-specific, that prevent governments from adopting tax structures more favourable to growth.

4545;Immigrants’ skills and how they integrate into the labour market are fundamental to becoming part of the host country’s economic fabric. Although skills and qualifications are obviously decisive determinants in immigrants’ economic and social integration, they do not necessarily indicate how well immigrants actually integrate or fare in the labour market, but rather their ability to do so. Skills have indeed a strong bearing on career paths, and influence what kind of job they find.Employment is often considered to be the single most important indicator of integration. Jobs are immigrants’ chief source of income and also help them – though there is no guarantee – to take their place in society by, for example, finding decent accommodation, interacting with others in the workplace, and learning the host-country language. Work further confers social standing in the eyes of the immigrant’s family, particularly children, and with respect to the host-country population. However, while employment is important per se, so is its quality. This chapter begins by considering immigrants’ skills. It compares their levels of educational attainment with those of the native-born (Indicator ), assesses their proficiency in the host-country language (Indicator ) and their access to adult education and training (Indicator ). It then examines immigrants’ labour market outcomes, analysing their employment, participation and unemployment rates (Indicators and ) and looking at indicators on labour market exclusion – long-term unemployment and involuntary inactivity (Indicator ). The chapter goes on to look at the characteristics of the jobs that immigrants hold: types of contracts (Indicator ), working conditions (Indicator ) and the skill levels of jobs (Indicator ). It also considers the match between workers’ educational attainment and the requirements of their occupations (Indicator ).

4672;"Technology (""science of craft"", from Greek τέχνη, techne, ""art, skill, cunning of hand""; and -λογία, -logia) is the sum of techniques, skills, methods, and processes used in the production of goods or services or in the accomplishment of objectives, such as scientific investigation. Technology can be the knowledge of techniques, processes, and the like, or it can be embedded in machines to allow for operation without detailed knowledge of their workings. Systems (e.g. machines) applying technology by taking an input, changing it according to the system\'s use, and then producing an outcome are referred to as technology systems or technological systems.\nThe simplest form of technology is the development and use of basic tools. The prehistoric discovery of how to control fire and the later Neolithic Revolution increased the sources of food, and the invention of the wheel helped humans to travel in and control their environment. Developments in historic times, the printing press, the telephone, and the Internet, have lessened physical barriers to communication and allowed humans to interact freely on a scale.\nTechnology has many effects. It has helped develop more advanced economies ( today\'s economy) and has allowed the rise of a leisure class. Many technological processes produce unwanted by-products known as pollution and deplete natural resources to the detriment of Earth\'s environment. Innovations have always influenced the values of a society and raised new questions in the ethics of technology. Examples include the rise of the notion of efficiency in terms of human productivity, and the challenges of bioethics.\nPhilosophical debates have arisen over the use of technology, with disagreements over whether technology improves the human condition or worsens it. Neo-Luddism, anarcho-primitivism, and similar reactionary movements criticize the pervasiveness of technology, arguing that it harms the environment and alienates people; proponents of ideologies such as transhumanism and techno-progressivism view continued technological progress as beneficial to society and the human condition.";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1

SDG 15 is a very ambitious goal—it encompasses all types of land-based ecosystems and biodiversity, with 12 targets and 12 indicators 2 that draw heavily from the Aichi Biodiversity Targets of the current Strategic Plan for Biodiversity 2011-2020. Both urban and rural societies rely on terrestrial ecosystems and biodiversity in various ways to strengthen their resilience. Vegetation acts as a carbon sink for partially offsetting urban emissions, and contributes to climate change mitigation through shade provision, rainwater interception and filtration, and pollution reduction. Increasing the biodiversity 1 This background note was prepared by the UN Department of Economic and Social Affairs’ Office of Intergovernmental Support and Coordination for Sustainable Development (UN-DESA/OISC) in collaboration with experts from the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the UN Environment Programme (UNEP), and the UN Development Programme (UNDP); the Secretariats of the UN Forum on Forests, the UN Convention to Combat Desertification, the UN Convention on Biological Diversity, The Ramsar Convention, and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species; the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS); and with inputs from the participants of the UN-DESA Expert Group Meeting on SDG 15 convened from 14 to 15 May 2018, as a contribution to the 2018 HLPF review of SDG 15.

4736;"The coast, known as the coastline or seashore, is defined as the area where land meets the sea or ocean, or as a line that forms the boundary between the land and the ocean or a lake. Around 620,000 kilometres (390,000 mi) of coastline are on Earth. Because of the coastline paradox, a coastline's exact perimeter cannot be determined. \nThe term coastal zone is used to refer to a region where interactions of sea and land processes occur. Both the terms coast and coastal are often used to describe a geographic location or region located on a coastline (e.g., New Zealand's West Coast, or the East and West Coasts of the United States).\nThe term pelagic coast refers to a coast that fronts on the open ocean, as opposed to a more sheltered coast in a gulf or bay. A shore, on the other hand, can refer to parts of land adjoining any large body of water, including oceans (seashore) and lakes (lake shore). Similarly, the somewhat related term stream bed or stream bank refers to the land alongside or sloping down to a river (riverbank) or body of water smaller than a lake. Bank is used in some parts of the world to refer to an artificial ridge of earth intended to retain the water of a river or pond; in other places this may be called a levee.\nWhile there is general agreement in the scientific community regarding the definition of a coast, in the political sphere, the delineation of the extents of a coast differ according to jurisdiction.

On the other hand, migrants are more likely to report not having been able to participate in training activities they were interested in, largely because of financial barriers and family responsibilities.

These include sound ecosystems to support triangular partnerships through high- political will, guiding documents, institutional structures, partnerships, resources and management procedures. Furthermore, against the background of the 2030 and the outcomes of BAPA+40, a shift of thinking from ‘donor-recipient’ relations to ‘partnerships’ needs to run through political discourse, public opinion, strategies and systems of all partners in triangular co-operation. Moreover, for the first time, the issue of ‘transaction costs’ in triangular co-operation is discussed systematically. Based on the research, interviews, and meetings that were conducted for this study, broad agreement emerged that these are investments in the partnership, and should not be regarded as costs. Finally, five options to engage effectively in triangular co-operation are offered. The decision for one of these five approaches, depends on the specific context of the partners that wish to set up new triangular co-operation initiatives.

However, sub- measures are scarce, given the complexity of producing indicators at the regional level from the available data and the methodological issues related to cross- comparability. This presents a set of indicators of income inequality and poverty and within regions for 28 . These indicators were produced through a new household-level data collection based on internationally harmonized income definitions undertaken as part of the project on “Measuring regional and local -being for policymaking”. The data were collected at the TL2 territorial level, corresponding to NUTS2 regions in Europe and to administrative subdivisions (e.g. States in Mexico and Unites States) for non-European . These confirm that there are significant variations in levels of income inequality within , and that regional breakdowns are useful for understanding sources and patterns of income disparities and poverty. For most of the relying on survey data for measuring income distribution, cross-sectional indicators of income inequality and relative poverty at this regional level are estimated with low precision in the smallest regions due to small samples. This has two main implications for data producers and analysts. First, systematic reporting of confidence intervals is needed to make meaningful comparisons of inequality levels regions and with respect to the averages. Second, averaged measures for multiple or small area estimation methods should be considered as means for obtaining more robust measures.

Page 3 of 10 and politically relevant response to halting and reversing biodiversity loss by 2030—can be adopted by the 15th Conference of the Parties to the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2020, and incorporated within the 2030 Agenda. Forests about four billion hectares—31 per cent—of the ’s land area in 2015. While rates of deforestation have decreased in the recent past from a net annual forest area loss of 7.3 hectares in 2000 to 3.3 hectares in 2015, they are still alarmingly high. The main driver of deforestation to be conversion of forests to agricultural land. In addition, forest degradation is increasing globally, mainly due to unsustainable use, often driven by poverty or poor land governance. Mountains cover about 22 percent of the Earth’s surface and are vital sources of , energy, biodiversity, agricultural products and livelihoods for a large portion of the ’s population. In 2017, 76 per cent of mountain areas were by some form of green vegetation, forests, shrubs, grassland and cropland, which tends to be positively correlated to the health of the mountains and their capacity to provide ecosystem ; but mountain ecosystems and the people who inhabit them are highly vulnerable to disturbances. About one fifth of the Earth’s land surface by vegetation showed persistent and declining trends in productivity from 1998 to 2013. Up to 24 km2 of land was affected, 19 per cent of cropland, 16 per cent of forestland, 19 per cent of grassland and 28 per cent of rangeland. In some cases, advanced stages of land degradation are leading to desertification in dryland areas, particularly in the grasslands and rangelands. It is estimated that 60 per cent of terrestrial biodiversity loss is related to production, while ecosystem to production are under pressure, with 33 per cent of soils moderately to highly degraded and freshwater ecosystems adversely impacted by extraction for agriculture and other uses, and by pollution.5 Globally, around 3.2 billion people are adversely affected by land degradation, and an estimated two billion hectares—equivalent to 17 per cent of all biologically productive land—could benefit from restoration.";0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0

In 2010, the REM Advisory Group published the “Policy Framework for Sustainable Real Estate Markets”, a tool that would help guide the member States to create real estate markets. However, the emergence of key agreements, such as the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, the Geneva UN Charter on Sustainable Housing, the New Urban Agenda, the Paris Agreement, and the Basel III Agreement, have led to the establishment of new and regional policy frameworks for future activities on urban development at all levels. In response to the request of the Committee to update the Policy Framework to reflect the emergence of such key agreements, the REM Advisory Group produced the current publication, which now includes updates on the issues such as urbanization, migration and mobility flows, technology and innovation, the of emerging markets and asset competition, the change in housing demand oriented towards green buildings and new designs, energy consumption and climate change, and other relevant phenomena. Moreover, this version of the Policy Framework for Sustainable Real Estate Markets maintains that, contrary to the widespread belief that finance and real estate sectors have negative impact on sustainability, they can actually contribute to the achievement of Sustainable Development Goals with the of effective and compatible principles. In particular, this publication shows that these principles can be incorporated by national, local and municipal governments and applied to various forms of real estate.;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0

5467;Experience with urban social assistance programmes is still limited. Many of the existing urban programmes are extensions or duplicates of rural programmes, but urban-sensitive social protection needs to reflect the distinct vulnerabilities of the urban poor. Furthermore, applying a child lens requires identifying and addressing the specific risks and multiple deprivations that are experienced by half of urban children in developing . As a result, designing social assistance for urban contexts faces challenges such as accurately targeting the poor (given the spatial geography of urban poverty) and setting appropriate payment levels (given the high and variable costs of urban living). Geographic targeting (e.g. informal settlements), proxy means testing (if urban-sensitive) and categorical targeting (e.g. street children) are popular mechanisms in urban areas, but community-based targeting is often inappropriate (because of urban social fragmentation) while self-targeting can be unethical (e.g. where wages below market rates are paid in public works projects) and might contradict rights-based approaches. These are relevant challenges to address when designing urban social protection programmes. We apply these reflections to Ghana. The country is a relevant case study because it is growing and urbanizing rapidly. But as the result of urbanization, urban poverty and deprivations are rising even though poverty rates have halved. Anti-poverty policies and social protection interventions remain biased towards the rural poor. The ‘urbanization of poverty’ in Ghana has created problems such as overcrowded housing, limited access to sanitation, and outbreaks of communicable diseases. This provides guidance on the critical questions to ask to design in Ghana a successful urban social protection programme with a child lens.;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

5774;"Gender is the range of characteristics pertaining to, and differentiating between, masculinity and femininity. Depending on the context, these characteristics may include biological sex (i.e., the state of being male, female, or an intersex variation), sex-based social structures (i.e., gender roles), or gender identity. Most cultures use a gender binary, having two genders (boys/men and girls/women); those who exist outside these groups fall under the umbrella term non-binary or genderqueer. Some societies have specific genders besides ""man"" and ""woman"", such as the hijras of South Asia; these are often referred to as third genders (and fourth genders, etc.).\nSexologist John Money introduced the terminological distinction between biological sex and gender as a role in 1955. Before his work, it was uncommon to use the word gender to refer to anything but grammatical categories. However, Money\'s meaning of the word did not become widespread until the 1970s, when feminist theory embraced the concept of a distinction between biological sex and the social construct of gender. Today, the distinction is followed in some contexts, especially the social sciences and documents written by the World Health Organization (WHO).In other contexts, some areas of the social sciences, gender includes sex or replaces it.";0;0;0;0;1;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0;0

Since 1990, income inequality trends in the continent have been multi-dimensional, exhibiting a rising, a falling, a U-shaped, or an inverted U-shaped (∩) trends. These variations emphasise the importance of achieving a deeper understanding of each of these trends in Africa towards identifying key drivers and to offer policy recommendations for the associated with each trend. Focusing on specific drivers of progress on income inequality allows for a clear understanding of why some make significant progress while others lag behind.
